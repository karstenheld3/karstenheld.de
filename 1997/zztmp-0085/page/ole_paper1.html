<h3>1. Overview of OLE</h3>



<p><b>A. What is OLE and COM</b></p>



<p>Prior to OLE1, managing compound documents usually involved cutting

and pasting object data to and from the clipboard, between the document

and the apps used to create these objects. This was cumbersome and there

were many limitations. </p>



<p>OLE1 was a technology based on DDE that was developed to support linking

and embedding objects (hence the name Object Linking and Embedding) created

in one application, called a server, into a document in another application,

called a container. The application functioning as a container was typically

responsible for owning the data associated with the object, and could sometimes

display the object. But when it came time to edit the object, a simple

double click would take care of loading the server application and sending

the data to the server. Now the user could see, edit, and manipulate the

object in the application that created it. When the user was done editing,

closing the server app would cause the object data to be sent back to the

container app. </p>



<p>The objects stored in a compound document can be thought of as a type

of software component, however there are many types of software components

that applications would like to be able to share. Creating software components

is one of the most effective methods of code reuse. In trying to solve

some of the limitations of OLE1 and expand its capabilities, Microsoft

developed a powerful general purpose object sharing technology called COM,

the Component Object Model. COM is the model used to program OLE2. OLE2

is now referred to as simply OLE (it doesn't need a version number, as

you will see), and it no longer stands for Object Linking and Embedding,

because it has become more general purpose. </p>



<p>With COM, the programmer gains access to a set of interfaces exposed

by the object. An interface is simply a group functions, usually related.

When programming OLE, one might create a COM object server that provides

an object with some functionality for use by other applications. In this

scenario, the programmer creating the object defines the object and codes

all of the interfaces to be exposed. In other scenarios, you may be adding

OLE object container or server functionality to your app, and in this scenario,

you must provide implementations for abstract interfaces that are already

declared by some other COM objects. </p>



<p>COM objects can live in many different locations. They are called &quot;in

process servers&quot; when they live in DLLs. COM objects in DLLs are the

most efficient in terms of call overhead since DLLs are loaded into the

process space of the application using them, and thus there is no interprocess

communication. They are called &quot;local servers&quot; when they live

in separate EXEs, in which case one application is talking across process

boundaries to reach the COM object that is off in another EXE. The process

of talking across process boundaries in OLE is called marshaling, and always

involves at least a little more overhead than simply talking to a DLL Now,

with Windows NT 4.0 (in beta 2 at this time) COM objects can also live

on a separate machine that is connected by a network. This technology is

being called DCOM, or Distributed COM. Once you have implemented a COM

object as a local server, it is trivial to make it capable of living out

on the network. </p>



<p><b>B. Advantages of COM DLLs over traditional DLLs</b> </p>



<p>DLLs are a great a way to share code in Windows. Unfortunately, the

traditional ways that DLLs are used make many things more difficult than

they should be. </p>



<p>One big problem is what is known as the versioning problem. Suppose

you have a DLL that provides a standard service, and you need to add to

it a host of new functions to extend the service or implement a new complimentary

service. </p>



<p>So now the question is, how do you provide the new service, that is,

these new functions? You could provide a new DLL with a different name,

but this isn't really ideal since each additional DLL an app uses adds

a fixed amount of overhead in load time and memory requirements, in addition

to any overhead related to the added function itself. If the new DLL has

the same name as the old DLL, how does an app know which DLL it is linking

to? Does the new app have the added functionality or not? True, your DLL

could have a version-info resource, but then it gets a little tricky keeping

straight which functions belong to which version, especially if you added

a lot of functions. Or you can link to the DLL with LoadLibrary and check

the returns from GetProcAddress, but again this gets a little tedious if

you have a lot of new functions. </p>



<p>Additionally, you get problems based on the fact that different vendors

providing this DLL may install it in different places. You then end up

with multiple copies of the DLL on the hard drive, and possibly multiple

versions, with the additional problem that apps may start loading the wrong

version. This in effect requires that users of the DLL check its versioning

in some way. </p>



<p>Its important to realize that these problems are not insurmountable.

We have been dealing with versioning DLLs for over 6 years and surviving.

But the solutions are clumsy, and prone to error. </p>



<p>COM provides an elegant solution to all of these problems. COM is an

object oriented system. The functions that you access in a COM object are

exposed via what we call interfaces. An interface is identical to the C++

concept of a vtable pointer. After initializing COM and loading your object

server, one of the most fundamental things you do as a client of a COM

object is ask for an interface pointer. You can obtain an interface pointer

by calling a standard method QueryInterface(). The interface pointer that

you get is a pointer to a vtable that contains the addresses of a set of

functions in the DLL. </p>



<p>This helps to solve the versioning problem in several ways. First of

all, when a service provider adds a new set of functions to the DLL, they

can all be encapsulated completely in a new interface (i.e vtable). A client

of the DLL doesn't need to know what version of the DLL it is using. It

simply calls QueryInterface() to determine if the new functionality is

present. If it is, a pointer is returned to a vtable, that contains the

addresses of ALL the new functions. This means that clients that are aware

of the new DLL version can gracefully check for the presence of the new

functionality by calling QueryInterface(), and the new functions are neatly

encapsulated in a vtable. No need to worry about trying to keep track which

functions are new. </p>



<p>Additionally, managing COM DLL versions on the hard drive is easier.

The COM client doesn't even know the name of the DLL. Instead, the COM

client references the COM objects in the DLL via a GUID, or a Globally

Unique Identifier. GUIDS are 16 byte numbers generated by an algorithm

that guarantees them to be unique in time and space (more on this later).

When the client wants a COM object, it refers to the GUID, and the system

goes about loading the COM DLL for you. It does this by looking up the

GUID in the registry to find the path and name of the DLL to load. </p>



<p>This is nice, because it means that the user of the DLL never needs

to worry about whether it's installed in the path, if it has the right

file name, if the DLL name changes with newer version, etc. </p>



<p><b>C. Advantages over C++</b> </p>



<p>Libraries of code that are statically linked suffer from the following

problems: </p>



<ol>

<li>Wasteful of disk space and memory space, since the same library may

get linked into many different modules.</li>



<li>The implementation of the objects in the library are permanently attached

to the module that linked them. Thus updates or fixes to the library can't

be delivered without recompiling the module. </li>

</ol>



<p>Since dynamically linkable objects don't suffer these problems, they

are very well suited for use as software components. However exporting

C++ classes from a DLL is somewhat problematic. The main issues are:</p>



<ol>

<li>Users of your object must use a C++ compiler </li>



<li>Except that even among C++ compilers, name mangling varies </li>



<li>Layout of objects is different across compilers for C++ classes using

virtual base classes, RTTI, and exception handling </li>

</ol>



<p>COM allows you to create polymorphic objects which are exported from

a DLL or EXE that can be used by virtually any language. It is based on

the concept of the standard vtable layout. All C++ compilers, and most

object oriented languages such as Delphi support this vtable format natively.

Other languages aren't left out in the cold either. In straight C, it's

a little more fuss because you have to fill in a structure with function

addresses, but it still works fine. Because interfaces are identified by

GUIDS, name linkage is also not an issue. </p>



<p><b>D. Aggregation </b></p>



<p>Aggregation is what happens to a person having a bad day. But seriously,

COM doesn't support true inheritance, in terms of how C++ defines it. It

does however support a similar object oriented principle known as aggregation,

which is a technique in which an object can contain other objects, and

expose the interfaces of the contained object as it chooses. </p>



<p><b>E Understanding COM design</b> </p>



<p>In trying to understand COM, it is useful to explain the design decisions

in terms of the following goal: Figure out a clean way to move a simplified

C++ like class into a DLL (or EXE) and have it be useable by any language.

</p>



<p>We have a couple requirements. </p>



<ol>

<li>The vtable(s) will be the only access to the class (i.e the interface(s)).

This is because its easy to ensure that the vtable is the first entry in

the object. Also, members are invoked via a function pointer only. This

is nice because we don't want any external linkage to actual members. For

this reason we don't allow exporting static member functions. We don't

allow exporting data because the layout in the object makes things more

complicated cross language. Thus the interface to a class is specified

as an abstract base class. This is appropriate since the compiler can't

fill in the vtable entries anyway, and it causes the compiler to enforce

the rule that the client can't try to construct one of these objects by

calling new. </li>



<li>Construction and destruction of the object must be kept inside the

COM object. Since we have abstract base classes, the client doesn't even

know the size of the object. This is also a requirement if we are going

to be compiler neutral. </li>



<li>We need a way to identify our COM objects, and make sure that our identifier

is unique (doesn't match someone else's COM object on the same system).

This is the motivation for GUIDS. </li>

</ol>



<p>These requirements motivate many of the design decisions in COM.

</p>

<hr size=1 width="100%" >



<h3>2. Programming COM </h3>



<p><b>A. GUIDS</b> </p>



<p>GUIDS, or Globally Unique Identifiers, are fundamental to COM. GUIDS

are simply 16 byte numbers, but their value lies in the fact that the algorithm

used to generate them guarantees them to be unique. </p>



<p>The point of the GUID, is that it represents a way to name all of your

classes and interfaces, and be guaranteed that they will be uniquely named.

This is important since there will be many, many COM objects living on

a system in a sort of global namespace, and therefore a way to keep names

from conflicting is mandatory. </p>



<p>GUIDS can be obtained in one of several ways. You can use the GUIDGEN

utility provided with the WIN32 SDK and most Compilers including Borland

C++. Or you can call Microsoft and they can allocate some GUIDS for you.

There is also an API in COM that you can call to get a new GUID at runtime.

</p>



<p><b>B. IUnknown</b> </p>



<p>All objects derive from the IUnknown interface. It is an abstract base

class that defines the three fundamental methods that all COM objects must

have: </p>



<ol>

<li>QueryInterface </li>



<li>AddRef </li>



<li>Release</li>

</ol>



<p>In C++ parlance, this is an abstract base class that looks like this:</p>



<pre>class FAR IUnknown {

  public:

    virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE QueryInterface( IID FAR&amp; riid,

                                                      LPVOID FAR* ppvObj) = 0;

    virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE AddRef(void) = 0;

    virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE Release(void) = 0;

};

</pre>



<p>Therefore, these three functions must be implemented by all COM all

objects. </p>



<p>QueryInterface is used to return an interface pointer to the Client

program. In C++ we do this by simply assigning the &quot;this&quot; pointer

to the second parameter of the QueryInterface function. The first parameter

is the GUID of the interface being requested. </p>



<p>This first parameter is present because it is possible for a class to

support more that one interface. This in effect means that the class has

two or more vtables. One way to achieve this in C++ is to have a class

that multiply inherits two different classes. In this case, to return a

pointer to one of the interfaces, you simply assign a cast of the &quot;this&quot;

pointer as the class type that is being Queried. </p>



<p>AddRef and Release are complimentary functions and manage what is known

as reference counting. This is an important and sometimes tricky aspect

of COM. Reference counting is used to control when a COM object should

be destroyed. A COM object doesn't go away until its reference count reaches

zero. A call to AddRef bumps the reference count of the object by one,

and a call to release decrements the reference count by one. The Release

function is in charge of destroying the object when it decrements the reference

count to zero. </p>



<p><b>C. The Rules of Reference Counting</b> </p>



<p>In order to properly control the lifetime of a COM object you must follow

the standard rules of reference counting. This means knowing when you must

call AddRef on your object, and when you must call Release. If you don't

follow the rules, your object may never get cleaned up, or worse, get destroyed

before it was supposed to be, causing run-time problems. </p>



<p>The general rule is that whenever a user makes a copy of an interface

pointer, the user should call AddRef, and then call Release when done using

it. Additionally, when passing pointers to and from functions, the following

three possible situations needs to be handled: </p>



<ol>

<li>Interface pointer passed in to a function -- In this situation, there

is no need for anyone to call AddRef or Release, unless someone makes a

copy of the pointer that will last outside the scope of the function, in

which case, the general rule above applies. </li>



<li>Interface pointer returned from a function -- In this case, the called

function must call AddRef on the pointer before returning it, and the caller

must call Release when it done with it. </li>



<li>Interface pointer passed into a function changes and is returned --

If the interface pointer doesn't change, nothing needs to be done. If a

new interface is substituted for the one passed in, the called function

must Release the old interface pointer and AddRef the new one. </li>

</ol>



<p><b>D. IClassFactory</b> </p>



<p>IClassFactory is the interface used to construct your objects. It is

a descendant of IUnknown, and would look like this: </p>



<pre>class FAR IClassFactory : public IUnknown {

  public:

    // inherited IUnknown methods

    virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE QueryInterface( IID FAR&amp; riid,

                                                      LPVOID FAR* ppvObj) = 0;

    virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE AddRef(void) = 0;

    virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE Release(void) = 0;

    // These are the two new methods of IClassFactory

    virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE CreateInstance( LPUNKNOWN pUnkOuter,

                                                      IID FAR&amp; riid,

                                                      LPVOID FAR* ppvObject) = 0;

    virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE LockServer(BOOL fLock) = 0;

};

</pre>



<p>All COM objects must provide an actual instance of a ClassFactory, so

that clients of the COM object can call the CreateInstance method of the

ClassFactory to create the COM objects supported. The LockServer method

is used when you need to ensure that the COM server doesn't get unloaded.

</p>



<p>

<hr size=1 width="100%" ></p>



<h3>3. In process servers </h3>



<p>Lets now take a look at how to implement a very simple COM server and

client. We will develop a trivial COM server and client application. The

COM server will provide a COM object with one interface that supports a

method for returning a random number. The client application will initialize

COM, load our COM object server, get the interface pointer, and start getting

random numbers using the method of the interface. </p>



<p><b>A. Exporting the DllGetClassObject() and DllCanUnloadNow() functions</b>

</p>



<p>A COM DLL must export two functions. The DllGetClassObject() function

is used to get the interface pointer to the ClassFactory. </p>



<pre>STDAPI _export DllGetClassObject(REFCLSID rclsid, REFIID riid, LPVOID FAR * ppv)

</pre>



<p>The first parameter is the Class ID (GUID) of the object for which you

want a ClassFactory. This means that you will get back a pointer to a ClassFactory

that can create objects of the type specified by the rclsid. The second

parameter is the interface of the ClassFactory requested. This should always

be IID_IClassFactory. The only other interface it would be valid to ask

for would be IID_IUnknown.</p>



<p>The client application will load the DLL by calling either CoGetClassObject()

or CoCreateInstance(), and pass in the Class ID of the object it needs.

The system then looks up the Class ID in the registry, loads the appropriate

DLL, and calls the DllGetClassObject() function in the DLL for you, to

return the ClassFactory to the Client. Here is a what our simple COM server's

DllGetClassObject must look like. </p>



<pre>// Global variable

// This is the instance of our class factory (its declared

// in the header file). This must be instantiated at DLL

// load time so that the DLLGetClassObject() function

// can return a pointer to it

static RandClassFactory rcFactory;



STDAPI _export DllGetClassObject(REFCLSID rclsid, REFIID riid, LPVOID FAR * ppv)

{

    *ppv = NULL;

    if( rclsid != CLSID_Rand)

    {

        return(ResultFromScode(E_FAIL));

    }



    if ( (riid != IID_IUnknown) &amp;&amp; (riid != IID_IClassFactory) )

    {

        return(ResultFromScode(E_NOINTERFACE));

    }



    *ppv = &amp;rcFactory;

    rcFactory.AddRef();



    return(NOERROR);

}

</pre>



<p>The DllCanUnloadNow() is used by the system to determine if it can unload

the DLL. It basically just returns true if it can and false if not, and

is prototyped like this: </p>



<pre>STDAPI _export DllCanUnloadNow(void)

{

    if ( (NumRandObjects == 0) &amp;&amp; (rcFactory.refCount == 0) )

    {

        return(ResultFromScode(S_OK));

    }



    return(ResultFromScode(S_FALSE));

}

</pre>



<p><b>B. The ClassFactory's CreateInstance method</b> </p>



<p>After the client has loaded the COM DLL and received the pointer to

the appropriate ClassFactory, it can now call the ClassFactory's CreateInstance

method to create the object. CreateInstance looks like this: </p>



<pre>// Creates the object requested, and returns the interface requested

STDMETHODIMP RandClassFactory::CreateInstance ( THIS_ LPUNKNOWN pUnkOuter,

                                                REFIID riid,

                                                LPVOID FAR* ppvObject)

{

    // the first parameter is a pointer an object that is aggregating

    // our object. We don't support this in our example.

    if ( pUnkOuter !=NULL )

    {

        return( ResultFromScode( CLASS_E_NOAGGREGATION ) );

    }



    LPRand pRand = new RandObj;

    if ( pRand == NULL )

    {

        return( ResultFromScode(E_OUTOFMEMORY));

    }



    // if the requested interface is not supported, we must

    // delete the object

    HRESULT hErr = pRand-&gt;QueryInterface( riid, ppvObject);

    if ( FAILED(GetScode(hErr)) )

    {

        delete pRand;

        return hErr;

    }



    return(NOERROR);

}

</pre>



<p><b>C. The Client application</b> </p>



<p>The sequence of steps the client will use to get to the COM object are

as follows: </p>



<ol>

<li>Initialize the COM system by calling the COM function CoInitialize().

</li>



<li>Load the DLL server by calling CoGetClassObject(), and passing the

ClassId of the COM object that we want. This returns a pointer to the ClassFactory

for the object requested. </li>



<li>Using the pointer to the ClassFactory returned, we then call the CreateInstance

member function of the ClassFactory to create our object and return an

interface pointer to it. We then have a working interface pointer, with

which to start using the COM Object. If the COM object supports additional

interfaces, we can call that COM object's QueryInterface method to return

any other interfaces. </li>

</ol>



<p>Since this is such a common sequence of events, COM provides a function

called CoCreateInstance that rolls the above steps two and three into just

one step. So, instead of calling CoGetClassObject followed by CreateInstance,

you can simply call CoCreateInstance. </p>



<p><b>D. The entire source code for a COM server DLL</b> </p>



<p>This should be compiled as Win32 DLL, and you must link with the OLE2W32.LIB

inport library. </p>



<pre>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

#include &lt;objbase.h&gt;
