Almost everyone who is not in the College of Letters and Science (L&S) is assigned an adviser prior to their first semester. This person helps with academic planning and is available for general consultation. <p>L&S undeclared undergraduates, including new frosh and transfer students, in the College of Letters and Science are not assigned a specific adviser. However, appointments are available with a diverse group of L&S advisers who provide academic counseling and help in program planning for undergraduates. For quick questions, you can receive prompt responses by e-mail: kpasaLnS@violet.<p>The College advisers are the primary advisers for undeclared students. They also conduct advising workshops for new students, give special assistance to students on academic probation, and offer specialized workshops for students (e.g. "Major Attraction: A Workshop on Choosing Your Major"). College advisers can help new students with credit evaluations of courses taken at other institutions and units assigned to Advanced Placement scores. The College advisers act as the representatives of the Dean of the College in approving student petitions. For more information about advisers or academic planning, you should read your College Announcement, which is mailed to you along with a welcome packet, or is available from the college or school.<p><strong>For undergraduate advising, information, or referrals call:</strong><br>Haas School of Business, 5450 Student Services Building, 642-1421<p>College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, 420 Latimer Hall, 642-3452<p>College of Engineering, 308 McLaughlin Hall, 642-7594<p>College of Environmental Design, 232 Wurster Hall, 642-0832<p>College of Letters and Science, 113 Campbell Hall, 642-1483<p>College of Natural Resources, 137 Giannini Hall, 642-0542<p><hr><strong>Graduate students</strong><br>Most new graduate students are assigned a graduate adviser in their department when they first arrive on campus. This faculty member helps students decide on which courses they need to take. A major adviser, who will direct a graduate student's research and thesis or dissertation, is usually chosen by the student, rather than assigned, and usually after the first year of graduate school. <p><hr><strong>Undergraduate majors</strong><br>Every student must select a field of concentration and pursue a major or curriculum, normally by taking a minimum number of units in one school or department. Occasionally, as in Business Administration or Optometry, the school and the department are the same. Admission to these schools is at the upper division level (after completion of 60 units of lower division requirements for Business Administration or 90 for Optometry). In Chemistry, Engineering, Environmental Design, and Natural Resources, you are admitted to the major you indicated on your application. <p><strong>In Letters and Science (L&S),</strong> however, because of enrollment limitations, you must seek admission to a major program after entering the University. You may declare your major when you have completed 30 units and all pre-major requirements, and you must declare by the time you have completed 60 units. Junior transfer students must declare a major by the beginning of their second term (113 Campbell Hall; 642-1483).<p>Although students may have indicated a desired major on the application for admission to the University, this does not guarantee admission to the major; students must still file a petition with Letters and Science. To declare a major in Letters and Science, obtain a petition from the College office or department and consult the department which sponsors the major for information on acceptance to the program. If you are accepted and the form has been completed and signed, return it to the department or College office. Be sure to read the descriptions of the various majors in the General Catalog. Faculty, department advisers, and fellow students in the major of interest can provide valuable insight. The College advisers in L&S provide guidance on choosing a major with individual appointments and workshops.<p>All new first year students will be mailed a copy of Smart Start: Guide to your first two years in the College of Letters and Science which contains information about L&S majors.<p><hr><strong>Changing your major</strong><br>Changing your major is as easy as declaring a major and happens just about as often. If you decide that the major you have chosen is not right for you (and often it's hard to know this until you have attempted some upper division course work in the subject), you need to see an adviser immediately to review what other majors you may be prepared for. Once you're a senior it may be very difficult to complete a new major within the unit maximums allowed by your school or college. If you cannot complete a new major within an appropriate time frame, the dean of your school or college may deny your petition to change your major. For this reason, it's critical that you plan a flexible program at the lower division level, in consultation with advisers, to give yourself options if you change your mind about your major.<p><hr><strong>Individual majors</strong><br>If you have sound academic reasons for developing your own major, a minimum GPA of 3.0, and you develop a program in consultation with a faculty member who will serve as your adviser, you may submit an Individual Major application. Students are required to include a senior thesis (Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies; 301 Campbell Hall; 642-0108).<p>The individual major may not duplicate other existing majors on campus. And, students should investigate the Interdisciplinary Studies Field major prior to attempting to declare an individual major.<p><strong>Double majors</strong><br>Students can declare a double major as long as they are able to complete requirements for both disciplines within 140 units, and they file lots of forms. It's even possible to pursue simultaneous degrees which would be two majors in two different colleges (e.g. L&S and Natural Resources). Deans of both colleges must approve the application (Office of Undergraduate Advising in L&S; 113 Campbell Hall; 642-1483).<p><strong>Minors</strong><br>While each student must complete a major, graduation with a minor is optional. The purpose of minors is to foster coherence in the academic work students complete outside their majors, and to provide official recognition by the University for such work.<p>There are currently 47 minors in the College of Letters and Science, 10 minors in the College of Environmental Design, and a minor in the School of Business Administration. Information on the various minors may be obtained from the school or college and from participating departments.<p><a name="Planning for the future"><h3><hr noshade>Planning for the future</h3></a><strong>Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)</strong><br>If you're unsure of what career you want to go into, start with a visit to CPS. They offer information on career counseling and testing (Tang Center; third floor, 2222 Bancroft Way; 642-9494). <p>The Counseling and Psychological Services Career and Educational Guidance Library has an extensive collection of materials for exploring educational and career options, including college catalogs, directories of graduate schools, and career books. There are interactive computer systems to help students discover occupations that match their unique skills, values, and interests (the small building in front of the Tang Center; 2220 Bancroft Way; 642-2367).<p><hr><strong>Career and Graduate School Services (CGSS)</strong><br>CGSS can help you with career planning and the graduate school admission process while you're still in school and after you graduate. By meeting with advisers and attending programs and workshops, you'll learn how to define your career objectives based on factual information about the world of work and an understanding of what you have to offer, given your education, life experience, and interests. CGSS teaches job search skills which will assist you in finding a job consistent with your needs, provides extensive job and internship listings and on-campus interviewing for employment opportunities.<p>CGSS also offers advice and assistance with application to medical, law, and other graduate schools, as well as informational handouts. The Letter of Evaluation Service, where you can store recommendation letters for future use, will send letters to graduate schools upon your request. <p>In the <a href="http://www.aad.berkeley.edu/uga/osl/cgss/">CGSS Resource Center</a> you will find occupational and graduate school information along with a calendar of workshops and programs (2111 Bancroft Way; 642-5207). <p>Most CGSS services are located at 2111 Bancroft Way:<br>General information	642-1716<br>Advising appointments	642-5207<br>Cooperative Education Internship Program	642-1532<br>Educational Career Services	642-3283<br>Graduate School Services	642-5207<br>Letter of Evaluation Service 643-6293<br>Disabled Students and Alumni Placement Program 642-0592<br>Economics and Business Administration Services (Chetkovitch Career Center, S-420, Haas School of Business)	642-8124	<dl><dt>Publications include:<dd>Career Planning Guide<br>Monthly Program Schedule<br>Placement Guide</dl><p><strong>Other resources</strong><br><strong>Doe Library</strong> has a complete microfiche collection of US college catalogs (Periodical Room).<p><strong>Student pre-professional organizations</strong> are listed on page 102 in the Extra matter section.<p><strong>Also</strong><br>Two other organizations that provide career information and workshops: the <a href="r8Campusactivities.html#Alumni">California Alumni Association</a> and the <a href="#YWCA">University YWCA</a>.<p><hr><strong>Professional Development Program</strong><br>The Professional Development Program (PDP) is an honors program designed to encourage minority and women students to realize their full academic potential for careers in academic and professional fields. Undergraduates are offered academic counseling, workshops, and placement in faculty-supervised research. PDP also provides graduate students with special orientations, workshops, and guest lectures. Additionally, students are assisted with obtaining internships and post-doctoral placement (230B Stephens Hall; pdpdata@garnet.berkeley.-edu; 642-5881).<p><a name="Student services"><h3><hr noshade>Student services</h3></a><strong>Student Life Advising Services (SLAS)</strong><br>SLAS provides students with academic, personal, financial, and career counseling and advising services. Professionally trained staff help students develop problem solving and self-management skills. The goal of SLAS is to motivate and direct students toward achieving academic excellence and to increase the number of low-income first generation and under-represented students that graduate from Berkeley. Counselors and peer advisers are available on both a drop-in and appointment basis to assist students with their concerns.<p>In addition to counseling and advising services, SLAS administers a wide range of programs to assist students in achieving their educational and career goals (140 Golden Bear Center; 642-7224).<p><strong>The Achievement Awards Program</strong> honors a select number of EOP/AA students each year with awards for academic achievement and community service.<p><strong>The Reduced Study-Load Program</strong> is designed for students admitted to the University by Special Action and/or those students mandated to enroll in this program. Participants are also required to enroll in an academic skills development option.<p><strong>The Peer Advising Program</strong> enhances students' social, personal, and academic adjustment to Berkeley.<p><strong>The Schedule Request Review</strong> requires a SLAS counselor to approve mandated students' course selections for an academic year.<dl><dt>Publications include:<dd>Student Life Advising Services Brochure</dl><p><hr><strong>Women's Resource Center </strong><br>The Women's Resource Center sponsors programs, workshops, student groups, and internships to promote greater campus awareness of and responsiveness to issues which affect women's experiences and opportunities as students. The Center provides individual problem-solving assistance including support in resolving sexual harassment situations, information on campus and community resources, as well as a comfortable resource library setting for exploration of personal and academic interests. It also serves as a supportive home base for a diverse array of student organized groups including:<p>AEROW (Advocating the Empower-  ment and Rights of Women)<br>ASPIRE (Asian Pacific American Women Initiating Rights and Empowerment)<br>Chicana/Latina Pipeline to Graduate School<br>Sistah Sistah (lesbian and bisexual women of color)<br>Sororities (AKA, Kamma Phi Delta, Lambda Theta Nu)<br>Student Parent Network<br>Women of Color Agenda<p>If you'd like to explore the Center's resource room/library, organize educational programs on current issues, create a specialized support group, expand your circle of friends, find support in dealing with difficult experiences, enhance your leadership skills, advocate for responsive policies and programs, or gain work experience, stop by the Women's Resource Center and introduce yourself.

If you are aware of a potential conflict, discuss it with your professor as soon as possible.<p><hr><strong>Beware</strong><br>Some cults use religion as a hook to pull in unsuspecting people; be sure to read the Cult awareness section (page 20) and to check with URC if you are unsure about a religious group.<p><a name="Counseling"><h3><hr noshade>Counseling</h3></a><strong>Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)</strong><br>CPS, a part of the University Health Services, provides career, academic, and personal counseling through individual sessions, couples counseling, group sessions, testing services, and occupational information. Counselors are a multicultural group of social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists.<p>Any Berkeley student can come in to talk about: deciding on a major, learning about interests and abilities, clarifying career goals, coping with personal crisis, dealing with concerns about family or other relationships, feelings of anxiety or loneliness, stress, gay and lesbian issues, what it's like to be at Berkeley, the effects of racism, or any of the many issues we all encounter. Talking with a counselor in a confidential, non-judgmental atmosphere can aid self-understanding and solution of personal issues.<p>The first two appointments are free; after two, there is a $12 charge per appointment. For groups there is a one-time fee of $20 for each group (Tang Center; 2222 Bancroft Way, third floor; 642-9494).<p>CPS offers workshops, training and consultation for student groups regarding various psychological issues.<p><strong>Social Services</strong> staff provide counseling and advocacy for sexual assault and alcohol/drug use; information and referral; and support for those with medically related issues (642-6074).<p><hr><strong>Peer advising </strong><p><strong>Student to Student Peer Counseling and Referrals (SSPC)</strong> is an ASUC peer counseling group designed to meet the needs of Berkeley students. The counselors, a diverse, non-judgmental and unbiased group of students, are available on a drop-in or phone-in basis. Services include counseling on a wide variety of issues and an extensive referral service for more specialized help. All services are free and confidential. New counselors are selected during the first week of classes each semester, and academic credit is available (300C and 318 Eshleman Hall; 642-9021). <p><a name="Procedural intervention"><h3><hr noshade>Procedural intervention</h3></a><strong>ASUC Student Advocate</strong> <br>The Student Advocate is elected every year during ASUC elections. With the help of several assistants, the Student Advocate helps students with University-related problems, concerning admissions, dismissals and transfers; financial aid problems; sexual harassment; student conduct; grade disputes; procedural problems; and UC housing or employment (204Eshleman Hall; 642-6912). <p><hr><strong>Office of the Ombudsperson for Students</strong><br>The Ombudsperson assists students with problems that seem insolvable by the usual procedures and agencies. If you have reached a procedural impasse or believe you have been treated unfairly in a University-related matter, the Ombudsperson may assist you in effecting a satisfactory solution (642-5754). <p><strong>Note</strong><br>The Student Advocate and the Ombudsperson both help students with University grievances. The Ombuds-person, unlike the Student Advocate, plays a non-advocacy role in problem resolution. <p><hr><strong>The Office of Student Conduct (OSC) </strong><br>OSC investigates and resolves cases of individual and student organizational misconduct, including allegations of academic dishonesty, forgery, hazing, inappropriate use of University resources, computer-related crimes, misuse of alcohol or drugs, physical abuse and threats of violence, and racial or sexual harassment or assault.<p>The Code of Student Conduct is enforced on all University owned or operated properties, at all University sponsored events, and within a limited geographical area surrounding the campus.<p>OSC works in conjunction with academic departments, residential units, health services, and campus and local police to ensure that the campus environment is as safe and productive as possible. If you would like a copy of the Code or have any questions, drop by or call (326 Sproul Hall; 643-9069).<p><hr><strong>The Observer Program </strong><br>This program was developed during the sixties by concerned faculty members who felt that neutral campus staff should observe campus events where there was a possibility of a conflict. Berkeley staff volunteers act as impartial witnesses at volatile campus events, and they provide objective reports and a calming effect (Student Activities and Services; 102 Sproul Hall; 642-6772).<p><hr><strong>Sexual harassment </strong><p><strong>The Title IX Officer</strong> addresses concerns, questions, and complaints regarding sexual harassment. She provides information and referrals about sexual harassment and investigates complaints. Contact Carmen McKines for more information (200 California Hall; 643-7985). <p><strong>The Women's Resource Center</strong> provides information and support in responding to and resolving sexual harassment experiences involving students. A staff resource specialist provides counseling, and can discuss options and explain campus policies and procedures (250 Golden Bear Center; 643-5730). <p><strong>SHAPE Project</strong> (Sexual Harassment Advocacy and Peer Education) interns offer workshops to student groups and residential living units. Academic credit is available (250 Golden Bear Center; 643-9861).<p><strong>The University Health Service</strong> coordinates education programs, crisis counseling, advocacy, and medical care for women and men who have been harassed or assaulted (Tang Center, 2222 Bancroft Way: Prevention, 642-7202; Victim Assistance and Counseling, Social Services, 642-6074 or Counseling and Psychological Services, 642-9494; or Medical Care, 642-3188).<p><hr><strong>Legal services </strong><p><strong>Student Activities and Services</strong> has an attorney on staff who can advise you regarding your legal rights and obligations if you have a problem or question about the law. The attorney is available Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, 9am to 4pm, during the fall and spring semesters and Tuesdays, 9am to 4pm during the summer. You need your current Cal Photo ID for an appointment for free consultation. If you require legal representation, you will be referred to appropriate resources (102 Sproul Hall; 642-4980). <p><strong>The ASUC Student Legal Clinic (SLC)</strong> is a comprehensive legal resource center which enables students to make informed decisions about legal problems. The Clinic offers information regarding legal problems on topics such as: bankruptcy, consumer issues, contracts, court appearances, divorce, immigration, insurance, small claims, and traffic violations. Services include attorney and agency referrals and Income Tax assistance. The SLC does not give legal advice (300A Eshleman Hall; 642-9986). <p><strong>Jury duty </strong><br>You may be called to serve as a juror if you are 18 years of age or older and have been a resident of your county for 30 days before being selected. Student status does not exempt you from serving, although the court will sometimes postpone your appearance in cases of midterms or finals conflicts. <p><a name="Fun facts"><h3><hr noshade>Fun facts</h3></a><p><strong>CGSS Major Events</strong><br>Graduate School Information Day, late October<br>International Affairs Career Day, early November<br>Law School Day, early November<br>MBA Day, mid-November<br>Minority Professional Job Fair, early February<p><strong>More Berkeley students</strong> have gone on to obtain PhDs than have graduates of any other university.

It's our goal to help you succeed. Don't be afraid to come to us with your questions and your problems. It makes us feel good when we can help!<dd>Joan Lubenow, Advising Assistant<br>Human Biodynamics<p><dt>Major advisers have to be the best people to talk to on campus--especially in the smaller majors like Development Studies or Peace and Conflict Studies. Those are the people who know everything you need and want to know about a major or field. I talked to an adviser in the Development Studies office. She told me all about the major, and even about alternate majors. She showed me what I would need to do to be on my way to a major in Development Studies. When I decided not to major in DS, I went to talk to a PACs advisor. She was just as helpful. She really cared about my interests, and wanted to make sure I was in the right place. She encouraged me to come and talk to her again, and made me feel comfortable enough to do so.<dd>Monica LaBriola, First year<br>Undeclared<p><dt>Even if you are not sure what you want to major in, talk to the pre-major adviser in the departments or programs that might interest you. They will give you an idea of what their program is like, and of what you might do to prepare and inform yourself further. They will also give you some personal contact with your large and friendly faculty. If only for this last reason, you should do this early in your college career--by the end of your first year.<dd>Anthony Newcomb, Professor<br>Music<p><dt>Don't worry too much about declaring a major. Take a variety of courses, and you're bound to find something for you!<dd>Stacy Readal, First year<br>Peace and Conflict Studies<p><dt>My first year here at Cal I struggled to find a major. I heard about the Career and Educational Guidance Library and how they could help you find out what your strengths and interests were. I used the computerized career and educational guidance system and learned a lot about myself and what I wanted to study. I still don't know what I want as an occupation, but at least I have a field of interest.<dd>Andrew Schwiebert, Sophomore<br>Psychology<p><dt>Because Cal is so large, in the beginning it can appear to be very cold and impersonal. However, it is important for you to know that in many offices there are people who do care and are concerned about you! Be sure to take advantage of the many resources and services that are available. Student Life Advising Services is definitely one of those caring resources. EOP and underrepresented minority students are especially invited to come by to meet with a Counselor or Peer Adviser.<dd>Pat Perkins, Office Manager<br>Student Life Advising Services<p><dt>Berkeley can be intimidating, its size, its people, even its dorm food.  Don't be afraid to allow yourself to adjust and adapt to this new type of environment. Life at Cal is more than studying; try to get involved in some extra-curricular activities. If you're faced with overcoming Berkeley's famous bureaucracy, remember what my faculty adviser told me: never accept "no" as an answer. There's always a way to accomplish your goals, it's your job to seek out those who can help you.<dd>Diana Fabian, First year<br>Civil Engineer<p><dt>If you are entering into a lease or rental agreement, be certain that you understand your rights and responsibilities before you sign the document.<dd>Beth D. Karren, Attorney<br>Student Legal Services<p><dt>The Student Advocate's office is a great source of help for students trying to cope with the confusion and bureaucracy of Berkeley. They deal with everything from discrimination to grade disputes. The office is staffed with hard-working caseworkers who work with their clients on a one-on-one basis.
