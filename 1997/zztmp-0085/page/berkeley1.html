Buildings, trees, landmarks. Maybe just a dog that likes to get wet. Here's a brief overview of the University's past and present.<h3><a name="The campus">The campus</h3></a><strong>In the beginning</strong><br>Until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1770s, an Ohlone Indian tribe known as the Huchiun had lived for thousands of years in the Strawberry Canyon area of the Berkeley hills and on the land which is now the campus. The Spanish brought religion and disease which, within 40 years, either assimilated or killed off the Huchiun (and other tribes). By the 1849 Gold Rush, this area was being used for cattle and dairy farms. <p>In 1860 the five year old College of California wanted to escape the booming growth of downtown Oakland and its unsavory influences (saloons and dance halls). The college trustees envisioned a pastoral and secluded campus where a student could develop an appreciation for knowledge and nature. They found the perfect spot on a farm along Strawberry Creek. <p>The oldest campus landmark is Founder's Rock at the corner of Hearst Avenue and Gayley Road. The trustees of the College of California stood at this outcropping and dedicated the surrounding property as the site of their new campus. In 1868 the private College of California merged with the state supported Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College, and the University of California was born. Berkeley was the first campus in the University of California system; that's why we get to call our school "Cal." <p>There are nine UC campuses which are governed by an independent corporation, The Regents of the University of California. The board, composed of elected officials and governor appointees, is responsible for establishing policy in areas such as affirmative action, student fees, admissions, and financial aid. Since 1975, the Regents have included a student member chosen from one of the campuses to serve for one year. Edward Gomez, a graduate student studying history at UC Riverside, is the representative for the 1995-96 academic year. Students interested in applying for the position can pick up an application in late September from Student Activities and Services. The application deadline is November 1 (102 Sproul Hall, 642-6772).<p><hr><STRONG>The Campanile and a few other buildings</STRONG><br>Sather Tower (that's "SAY-thur"), Berkeley's most ubiquitous building and symbol, is best known as the Campanile (and that's "Cam-pa-KNEE-ly") which means "bell tower" in Italian. The tower was dedicated to and funded by Jane Krom Sather, a major donor to the University. Completed in 1914 by campus architect John Galen Howard (who also designed thirteen other existing campus structures as well as the building which became Cloyne Court co-op), the Campanile is still the tallest building on campus, soaring to 307 feet and surmounted by a carillon of 61 bells. The observation level is open to the public from 10am to 3:30pm, Monday through Saturday and 10am to 1:45pm on Sunday. The Campanile is accessible by elevator (free to students, faculty, and staff with ID, otherwise 50 cents). The surrounding grounds are a nice area for eating lunch and listening to the carillon played by Ronald Barnes, the University Carillonist, and other bell ringers (7:50am, noon, and 6pm, Monday through Saturday and at 2pm on Sundays). The Campanile also houses many of the paleontology department's fossils. Every decade or so, some wiseacres attach a Mickey Mouse on the Campanile's clock face and white gloves on the hands. It's not a good idea to try it though; you might break your neck or get arrested by the University Police.<p>The surrounding grounds are a nice area for eating lunch and listening to the carillon played by Jeff Davis, the University Carillonist, and other bell ringers (7:50am, noon, and 6pm, Monday through Saturday and at 2pm on Sundays).

It's not a good idea to try it though; you might break your neck or get arrested by the University Police.<p>The oldest extant campus building is the School of Library and Information Studies' South Hall, a Victorian which dates back to 1873. South Hall was one of the original two buildings; the other, North Hall, was razed in 1917. University House near Tolman Hall is where the Chancellor lives, and the bank in front is landscaped with flowers in the shape of a clock that really works. The Bike Bureau, a small brick building behind Sproul Hall, was constructed in 1904 as a steam plant. Over the years it was: adorned with Works Project Authority (WPA) mosaics; an art gallery (until the University Art Museum was completed in 1970); storage; and is now home to UCPD's Bike Bureau and Mainly Stationery (an office supply store for campus departments). <p>A funding campaign called "Keeping the Promise" raised over $486 million dollars for new construction and capital improvements. Among these projects are the now completed seven story Soda Hall on Hearst Avenue where the Computer Sciences and Electrical Engineering departments are housed, the underground stacks (shelves) linking Moffitt and Doe libraries, and the Haas School of Business.<p>The landmark with the most interesting nomenclature is Ludwig's Fountain in Upper Sproul Plaza. The fountain was dedicated and named for a German short-hair pointer, Ludwig, who waded daily in the Plaza fountain between 1960 and 1965.<p><hr><STRONG>New construction</STRONG><br>The University is finishing up a building boom! You may be thinking, "Heck, I hope they didn't raise my fees for this!" Well, rest assured, the new construction is funded by gifts (about 60% of the total cost) and state and campus monies specifically set aside for capital improvements (for more information, call 643-9363). <p><strong>Here's what's happening: <br>Doe and Moffitt Libraries Addition and Seismic Improvements, Step 2</strong> is scheduled to continue to the end of January 1997.<p><strong>Dwinelle Hall Expansion</STRONG> will convert the south wing attic into offices, construct two new floors in place of the north wing attic, and allow state-of-the-art computer communication to all offices. Construction is scheduled from June 1996 to the end of fall semester 1997.<p><strong>Haas Pavilion</STRONG> will expand seating at Harmon Gymnasium from approximately 6700 to 12,000 seats and will include seismic strengthening, fire, life safety, and ADA upgrades. Construction is scheduled for early 1997, to be completed for the 1998 basketball season.<p><strong>McCone Hall Renovation and Seismic Safety Corrections</STRONG> will provide newly re-configured and renovated space for the four departments in this six story building and life safety and ADA upgrades. Construction is scheduled from spring semester 1997 to summer 1998.<p><strong>Tan Hall</STRONG> (to house Chemical Engineering and Chemistry) construction is in progress next to Latimer Hall. The new building should be finished by Fall 1996.<p><strong>Unit 2 Residence Hall</STRONG> will undergo interior renovations and seismic upgrades which should be completed by Fall 1996. <p><strong>School of Law Expansion</STRONG> involves renovating Boalt Hall, converting former residential towers into offices and construction of a new north addition. Construction should be completed by fall 1996.<p><strong>Note:</STRONG> Most areas of all buildings being renovated will be accessible during construction.<p><strong>Future projects</STRONG><br><strong>Environmental, Health and Safety (EH&S) Facility</STRONG> will replace the existing Canyon Chemical Facility to collect and sort hazardous chemical materials and low-level radioactive wastes generated from campus teaching, research, and operations. Construction is scheduled for summer 1997 through summer 1998.<p><hr><STRONG>The landscape</STRONG><p>In the 1800s Berkeley had been a sloping grassy plain dotted by coast live oaks and divided by several forks of Strawberry Creek. Today there are many thousands of plant species on campus imported from Mediterranean climatic regions all over the world. <p>The eucalyptus trees found in the hilly Centennial Drive portion of the campus and the Eucalyptus Grove were brought from Australia during the 1870s by foresters who thought they had discovered a new lumber source. (Eucalyptus, unfortunately, has a swirling grain which makes it useless for construction!) These Tasmanian bluegums in the Grove form the tallest hardwood stand in North America.<p>The campus landscape is decorated with plant life in a way that complements the architecture. For instance, classically designed buildings, such as Sproul Hall and the Main Library, have very Romanesque landscaping. The London Plane Trees in Sproul Plaza are pruned yearly in the Italian style of pollarding. Cutting back to the same scars gives them their unique knuckled look in the winter. <p><hr><STRONG>Strawberry Creek</STRONG><br>One of the reasons the College of California trustees chose the University site was the presence of Strawberry Creek. In 1876 a large brick reservoir, fed by the creek, was built where Memorial Stadium now stands. The water supplied the campus and local community. As Berkeley traded its grasslands for non-native vegetation, asphalt, and housing, the creek deteriorated from the increased runoff (causing flooding and erosion), culverting, and pollution from sewage, heavy metals, and silt. <p>Two forks of Strawberry Creek cross the campus; the North Fork surfaces at University House (the Chancellor's residence) and the South Fork empties from a culvert behind the Women's Faculty Club. (A third fork had been drained in 1877 to make way for a running track which has since been covered by the Valley Life Sciences Building.) The forks merge in the Eucalyptus Grove, and then the creek disappears at Oxford Street, continuing almost completely underground until the water reaches the San Francisco Bay. <p>The campus Office of Environmental Health and Safety began a creek restoration project in the spring of 1987 which included sewer system rehabilitation and vegetated cribwalls to prevent erosion. In the spring of 1989 native threespine stickleback fish, which grow to about two inches long, were restocked. The last fish seen in Strawberry Creek had been silver salmon in 1930! If you look closely in pools along the South Fork behind Dwinelle Annex or just east of Sather Gate you may find stickleback, or even crawdads, hiding out under the rocks. <a name="The people"><h3><hr noshade>The people</h3></a><p><strong>Our leader</strong><br>Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien, Berkeley's seventh chancellor, assumed his position on July 1, 1990. He was born in China, but his family was forced to flee during World War II and the Chinese civil war. Tien studied mechanical engineering at the National Taiwan University. In 1956 he came to the US to study at the University of Louisville where he recalls, "Everything was segregated: the drinking fountains, the lunch counters, the buses. That was very dramatic for a young immigrant."<p>Tien then went to Princeton University and earned his PhD; in 1959 he joined Berkeley's faculty. An international authority in thermal radiation, Tien was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, received Berkeley's Distinguished Teaching Award, and chaired the Department of Mechanical Engineering. After spending 29 years at Berkeley, he left for UC Irvine to be Executive Vice Chancellor. He finished his second year at Irvine and then returned to Berkeley as our Chancellor. The Chancellor can relate to the student experience at Berkeley; his two daughters and son are graduates!<p><hr><STRONG>Who you are</STRONG><br>A phrase commonly heard on campus is "Excellence through Diversity," and for good reason. As part of the Berkeley community you'll be surrounded by incredibly intelligent people of different ethnicities, religions, nationalities, sexual orientations, economic backgrounds, ages, and physical abilities. Berkeley takes tremendous pride in the fact that the rich ethnic and cultural diversity of California is reflected in our student body.<p><strong>Ethnic composition, fall 1995</strong><br>21,176 undergraduates<br>African American 	1199<br>American Indian/Alaska Native  255<br>Caucasian/White 	6362<br>Chinese American 	4052<br>East Indian/Pakistani 	 649<br>Japanese American 	 386<br>Korean American 	1429<br>Pilipino/Filipino 	 545<br>Pacific Islander 	 69<br>Other Asian 	1113<br>Chicano 	1908<br>Latino 	956<br>International 	 776<br>Other/no data 	1477<p><strong>8,454 graduate students</strong><br>African American 	 344<br>American Indian/Alaska Native   59<br>Caucasian/White 	4764<br>Chinese American 	 587<br>East Indian/Pakistani 	 165<br>Japanese American 	 166<br>Korean American 	 157<br>Pilipino/Filipino 	 98<br>Other Asian 	 102<br>Chicano 	 294<br>Latino 	 242<br>International 	1127<br>Other/no data 	 338<a name="Student history"><h3><hr noshade>Student history</h3></a><p><strong>The Big Game, Oski, and the Axe</strong><br>No university is really complete without football, and the Bears' ultimate match, the Big Game is against Leland Stanford Junior University. Taking place November 23, 1996, in Cal's Memorial Stadium (alternating each year between home fields), this exciting game between Cal and the folks at Stanford ("the Farm") brings loyal fans from both universities together for some good old rivalry.<p><strong>Cal's colors</strong> are Yale Blue (because a large number of early campus administrators and faculty were Yale graduates) and California Gold (from the 1849 Gold Rush). White and especially red are Stanford's colors; woe to the Cal fan who accidentally wears red-hued clothing to the Big Game.<p><strong>Cal's Memorial Stadium,</strong> directly east of the main campus and rated as one of the five most beautiful stadiums in the country, will host six home football games this fall. During home games, the Victory Cannon fires from Tight Wad Hill (behind Memorial Stadium and named for the people who watch the game from there, instead of buying tickets) after each Cal score. On the Hill is the Big "C" measuring 60 x 27 feet. This letter was built in 1905 by freshmen and sophomore students in an attempt by the administration to alleviate interclass tension. Now, it's often attacked with red paint by members of the Farm prior to Big Game.<p>Two important Cal symbols are Oski the bear and the Axe. Cal's mascot, the Golden Bear (a grizzly), was chosen in 1895 by the track team. Live bear cubs toted to early sports events were named "Oski," from the popular cheer that begins, "Oski wow wow! Whisky wee wee!" An anonymous student in a molded polyurethane bear's head, yellow sweater, blue pants, and big shoes has since replaced a real bear. <p><strong>The Axe</strong> has a colorful past. In 1899, during a Cal/Stanford baseball game, Stanford cheerleaders insulted Cal fans by brandishing an axe while yelling the Stanford cheer, "Give them the axe, the axe, the axe! Where? Right in the neck, the neck, the neck!" Certain Cal True Blues stole the Axe during an unguarded moment, and an all-out chase ensued through San Francisco and Berkeley alleys.<p>For thirty years Cal taunted Stanford with the Axe, until Cal-disguised Stanfordites recaptured it during a rescue mission complete with tear gas bombs. Plots became so elaborate that both student bodies decided to mount the Axe on a plaque and award it each year to the Big Game winner. Out of 98 games, 67 points separate the two teams: Stanford has 1501 points and Cal has 1434. Cal's won 39 games, lost 48, and tied 11.<p>For information on Student Rooting Section season passes for fall and spring intercollegiate athletics, contact the Athletic Ticket Office (61 Harmon Arena; 642-5150).<p><hr><STRONG>Activism</STRONG><br>Political activity and protest has brought Berkeley national attention from way back. In the 1930s, large protest movements were led against fascism and the University "loyalty oath." During the supposedly apathetic fifties, Berkeley students rallied against racism and the McCarthy proceedings where hundreds of Americans were accused publicly of communism.<p>Berkeley garnered an international reputation as a political hot spot in the sixties with activism concerning civil rights issues, the Viet Nam War, and People's Park. Campus protests brought an end to compulsory military training requirements in 1962, and the Free Speech Movement (FSM) in 1964 resulted in a solidification of students' right to protest. In 1969 students of color, who were then only 1.5% of the student body, joined forces to organize the Third World Strike. Their demands established an Ethnic Studies Department, social and academic support systems, and heavily influenced current trends toward a more diversified faculty and student body.<p>This tradition of activism has continued with demonstrations denouncing the Persian Gulf war; US investments in South Africa; laboratory animal abuse; and nuclear arms proliferation. More recently students have protested: the increase in student fees; for recognition of Ethnic Studies Programs as Departments (this status would increase funding); and the Regent's decision to end Affirmative Action in admissions and hiring.<p>A one hour, student-produced show on the history of activism at Berkeley is available for student use (slides, video, or audio cassette, Student Activities and Services; 102 Sproul Hall; 642-6772).<p><a name="Once a year"><hr><STRONG>Once a year</STRONG></a><p>There are a number of annual activities to watch out for: E-week (a five-day celebration by engineering students), National Volunteer Week, the National Chicano Student Conference, Cal Carnival, and the Cal Band Spring Show, to name a few.<p><strong>Welcome Week</strong> (August 19 through August 23) previews the fall semester with workshops, open houses, and orientation activities for all new students. Welcome events continue during the Chancellor's "Smooth Transition" period during the first few weeks of classes. <p><strong>The Chancellor's Reception for New Undergraduates,</strong> Wednesday September 4, 1996, gives new students a chance to meet the Chancellor and Mrs Tien. (If you don't get an invitation in the mail by mid-August, check with Public Ceremonies; 642-3687.) <p><strong>The Student Activities Fair</strong> on Thursday, September 5, 1996, allows students to visit with over 100 student groups at their tables on Sproul Plaza. <p><strong>New spring undergraduates</strong> will be invited by the Chancellor and his wife to an afternoon welcoming reception. (If you don't get an invitation, call Public Ceremonies; 642-3687.)<p>Also during the spring there's National Condom Day; in March Charter Day celebrates the University's 129th birthday and Lambda Chi Alpha fills Sproul Plaza with flowers during the annual Daffodil Festival (since 1946 proceeds from the sale have gone to charity); and in April the Student Musical Activities Jazz Ensembles hosts the Pacific Coast Collegiate Jazz Festival where more than 120 groups compete for honors, and Cal invites the public and the campus community to Cal Day, a campus-wide open house.<p><strong>Graduation</strong>, which includes 55 different ceremonies, occurs during the last few weeks of school. The Office of Public Ceremonies updates a list of all graduations and speakers (642-3687). Also for graduating seniors, the Chancellor and the Alumni Association host a Commencement Convocation followed by a reception at University House, the Chancellor's home.<p><strong>The University Medal,</strong> which was established in 1871 by the UC Regents, is awarded to the "Most Distinguished Graduating Senior." Ruth Bender, who studied Lingustics, was chosen from over 6000 graduating seniors for the 1995 award. She spent a year abroad in Japan as a Monbusho Scholar and finished her four year career at the University with a 4.0 GPA and 18 A+'s! The recipient is selected by the Committee on Prizes, an Academic Senate Committee.Good advice and facts<a name="Fun facts"><h3><hr noshade>Fun facts</h3></a><p><strong>Happy birthday dear Berkeley</strong><br>As the flagship university, Berkeley shares its birthday, March 23, with the University of California system.<p><STRONG>The University seal</STRONG> was designed by Tiffany and Company in 1910. "Let there be light" is a translation of our Latin motto, 'Fiat Lux.'<p><STRONG>Sather Gate</strong> is one of the many structures designed by John Galen Howard and funded by Jane K. Sather; it was built as a memorial to her husband, Peder Sather, a University trustee. Telegraph Avenue used to lead right up to Sather Gate; you can still see the circle in front where trolley cars would pick up and deposit passengers. When the Gate was completed in 1910, a series of eight panels with nude men and women representing various fields of learning (Agriculture, Architecture, Art, Electricity, Law, Letters, Medicine, and Mining) decorated the four pillars. The classical nudity offended some people, and the controversy was brought to the attention of Mrs Sather who was bedridden and hadn't seen the Gate yet. When she saw pictures of the panels, she denounced them as disgusting and called upon University President Benjamin Ide Wheeler to "cut them out." The panels were removed, put into storage, and forgotten. In 1977, a curator for the University Hearst Museum of Anthropology saw two of the panels in a UC warehouse. The other six were tracked to a marble company that had gotten them from a scavenger who had cleaned out a pile of junk on the Berkeley campus. All of the panels were brought back by the University and re-installed on the Gate in 1979.<p><strong>Can't go to the games?

For instance, they'll say, "Hey 21, you're our Tuna for tonight!" Then whenever that player has or even touches the ball, Cal fans go wild and scream, "TUNA" and make noise. The second he no longer has the ball, the noise stops. <p>The band does the same thing at the women's basketball games, except they pick a "Bonnie" instead of "Tuna."<p><strong>Political persuasions of new Berkeley undergraduates, fall 1993</strong><br>Far left  10%<br>Liberal   36%<br>Middle of the road   38%<br>Conservative  13%<br>Far right  2%<p><strong>Political persuasions Nationwide, freshmen fall 1993</strong><br>Far left  2.5%<br>Liberal  24.7%<br>Middle of the road  49.9%<br>Conservative  21.4%<br>Far right  1.5%<p><strong>Late Night with Cal Basketball</strong><br>Here's a cool tradition: the basketball season officially begins with a midnight game between the offense and the defense in Harmon Arena.

It is what makes the campus a great and unique place. The Berkeley Experience derives from involvement in excellence and from the excitement of making things happen. Excellence is everywhere in Berkeley--you can't avoid it. It's in your major field, but most of it is outside your major. All you have to do is put yourself forward, be a little bold, and say yes. For some of us that, however, is not easy. Give yourself a chance. You will never be the same again.<dd>CD Mote, Jr, Professor<br>Mechanical Engineering and Vice Chancellor, University Relations<p><dt>If by chance you see Chancellor Tien walking through campus, take the time to say hello. You'd think he's too busy, but he always offers a friendly word or two. During finals, he would walk around Moffitt Library and tell students "Not to study too hard" and "Good luck!" He always wants to know how you're doing.<dd>Jason Wu, Sophomore<br>Chemical Engineering<p><dt>Get in the habit of reading the campus bulletin boards as you pass through the halls, they're perhaps the best source of campus riches.<dd>Daryle Corr, Coordinator<br>Committee on Prizes</dl><p> Go to:<br><a href="r96ToC.html"><STRONG>Resource table of contents</STRONG></a><br><a href="r2Thingstodofirst.html"><STRONG>Next chapter</STRONG></a><br><a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/"><STRONG>UC Berkeley Home Page</STRONG></a><p>
