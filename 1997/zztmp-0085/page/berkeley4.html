Undergraduates can enroll in up to 10.5 units, and graduates can sign up for 12.5 units. During this time you are free to adjust your schedule as many times as you wish as long as you don't exceed these unit restrictions. The reason you can't sign up for a full load all at once is to increase the chances of everyone getting at least some of the classes they need.<p><strong>Phase II</strong> starts immediately after Phase I ends. You are allowed to enroll in up to the maximum number of units allowed by your college or school. <p><strong>The Adjustment Period</strong> begins a week before instruction and extends through the third week of classes. You will still use Tele-BEARS to add or drop classes during this time. <p>For undergraduates, a $10 late fee will be charged for each class dropped after the second week of instruction (so don't hog classes!). If you still need to make changes after the third week, you must use a petition to add or drop courses (bummer). The fee to add a class is $5. <p><strong>Appointment days</strong> are assigned to every student during each Phase to spread out the calls and to keep the phone lines from overloading. Each student is assigned a specific day and time and allowed ten minutes per phone call. Since classes are filled on a first-come, first-served basis, you should call as soon as your appointment allows. On your appointment day, you may call as many times as you wish during operating hours to review or change your schedule. <p>You cannot call Tele-BEARS before your appointment time; you'll be cut off if you do. If you miss your appointment, you can still call anytime during the 24 hours after your appointment and during open hours, which are 7am to 8am and 7pm to 10pm, Pacific Standard Time. For security, every student is also assigned a Personal Identification Number (PIN), similar to a PIN for your ATM card, which must be entered after you punch in your Student ID number. In addition, students who require advising (and that includes all new undergraduates, see next section) will be assigned an Adviser Code (AC) which must be obtained from their adviser.<p><hr><strong>New students</strong><br><strong>All new undergraduates</strong> will obtain their ACs when attending a Cal Student Orientation (CalSO) program. Information about CalSO will be mailed to all new undergraduates (in May for fall semester students and in October for spring semester students). Students unable to attend should contact CalSO directly (New Student Programs; 137 Golden Bear Center; 642-4970).<p>The Office of the Registrar will mail you a Tele-BEARS registration form prior to CalSO. The form will indicate your Phase II appointment time. <p>Appointments are not needed for the Adjustment Period, but you have to call according to an alphabetical call-in schedule (see the Schedule of Classes for times.)<p><strong>New undergraduates,</strong> will also receive a Schedule of Classes with the CalSO Brochure which lists all courses to be given at Berkeley for the semester, along with their meeting times, locations, and instructors.<p><strong>If you're a new graduate student,</strong> you will have to obtain your registration form from your department before school starts.<p><strong>If you are hearing impaired</strong> and need help with Tele-BEARS, contact the Disabled Students Program (TDD 510/642-6377).<p><hr><strong>After Tele-BEARS</strong><br><strong>A Confirmed Class Schedule</strong> will be mailed to you after you have completed Phase II which indicates all classes in which you have enrolled through Tele-BEARS. <p><strong>A validation sticker</strong> for your Cal Photo ID will also be included if you meet all of the following criteria:<p>1) You must be enrolled in at least one course;<p>2) Your registration fees must have been paid, either in full or the first installment. (If you're receiving a partial offset for financial aid, you still need to pay at least the first installment of the remaining balance.); and,<p>3) You must have no blocks (like library fines) against your registration. <p>The sticker means you're a real officially registered student!<p><hr><strong>How to choose classes</strong><br>Before actually choosing your classes and creating a schedule, you need to arm yourself with three essential reference materials: the General Catalog, which lists all the classes offered at Berkeley; the Schedule of Classes, which lists the logistical information about classes like where they meet, who is teaching, how many units, and the examination groups of each of these classes; and the College Announcement, which describes the University and college requirements, and breadth requirements for your major (<a href="r5Findinghelp.html#Advising">click here</a> for information about getting a copy). Transfer students should contact their major department to find out about required courses, as well as when and how to declare.<p>Then you should read the entire General Catalog, no kidding. Take notes. Write down upper division classes you'd like even if you're a first year student, because by informing yourself about upper division classes you can: identify the lower division prerequisites for those classes; and see how these classes that interest you fit into specific majors, which helps make the choice for a major that much easier. While reading the Catalog, make lists of all the classes you'll ever be interested in taking while you're here.<p>From your lists, match the classes with requirements specified in your College Announcement and fill out your schedule accordingly. Try to keep a balanced schedule by taking a required class, a breadth requirement, and an elective; also think about mixing humanities requirements with math and sciences requirements. <p>Then check to see how many of these classes you could actually take, which ones are offered and that you have the prerequisites for. Include in these lists the class meeting times and the exam groups which you can get from the Schedule of Classes. When certain exam groups and class times conflict, you need to prioritize these classes and make two new lists. <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>Class times<br>1) Sociology 3, MWF 11-12 <br>2) Psychology 1, MWF 11-12<p>Exam groups		<br>1) Ethnic Studies 21, Exam 2<br>2) Anthropology 1, Exam 2<p>This will help you make the most of your Tele-BEARS appointments; instead of thumbing through the Schedule of Classes desperately trying to find an open class, you'll have a list of your options right in front of you. If Tele-BEARS can't give you Soc 3 because it's full, then you'll know, from your list, that you can try the Psych class; likewise if you weren't given Ethnic Studies, you can take Anthro.<p><hr><strong>Waiting lists</strong><br>If you can't add a course because it's full, get on the Waiting List right away! If space becomes available later (either through drops or an increase in seats), students on the waiting list get first crack at enrollment. Tele-BEARS keeps the waiting list in priority order; that is, the first student who places him or herself on the waiting list is number 1, the second student is number 2, and so on. <p>Remember, the units for wait-listed classes are included as part of your overall unit total.<p>It's important to know that there are two kinds of waiting lists: automatic and manual. With automatic waiting lists, Tele-BEARS enrolls wait-listed students in priority order at specific intervals throughout the enrollment period. For example, during the Adjustment Period, automatic waiting lists are run each weekend. See the Schedule or Classes for specific dates. If you're on an automatic waiting list, it wouldn't do you any good to call Tele-BEARS to check on your waiting list status until after the list is processed. <p>With manual waiting lists, it's the departments, not Tele-BEARS, that do the enrolling. Departments use their own set of criteria to determine which students get enrolled, which means that they can pick and choose from the list as they please, without regard to the order of the list. Manual waiting lists can be processed at any time, in other words they are not restricted to the fixed times of automatic lists. When you place yourself on a waiting list, Tele-BEARS will tell you whether it's automatic or manual. But remember, an automatic list can be changed to manual (or vice versa) at any time, and as many times as the departments want.<p>If you're still on the waiting list by the time classes begin, it's a good idea to go to the first class meeting to demonstrate your intent to enroll in the course. You'll also be able to get a more realistic idea about your chances for enrollment in the course.<p>If you're still on the waiting list by the time Tele-BEARS is over (after the third week of classes), you'll have to add the class by petition, once you're allowed in.<p><hr><strong>Two more things</strong> <br>1) Take it easy your first semester. Academic expectations at Berkeley are going to be different than what they were at your high school or community college. You can always buckle down next semester, after you've made some new friends, found your way around campus, and learned how to do your own laundry.<p>2) Everyone wants to know, What's a good class? We received responses to this question from over 200 undergraduates, and their answers are listed on pages 94-99. <p>The Women's Resource Center also keeps an informal student-initiated course evaluation list in their library (250 Golden Bear Center).<p><strong>CALPEP</strong> lists course and professor evaluations. Information is compiled by the ASUC Student Advocate's Office (214 Eshleman Hall; advocate @ocf.berkeley.edu; 642-6912).<dl><dt>Helpful publications:<dd>College and School Announcements, important information regarding school and college course requirements (New undergraduates will be mailed one, or go to your college or school for a copy).<br>General Catalog, lists descriptions of courses; school, college, and University academic regulations; and much, much more in tiny print ($5.91; Bear Student Store Textbooks; MLKJ Student Union; 642-0770). (To order a copy by mail, call 510/444-6251. Cost is $11.00 plus tax for first-class mail; for faster service, you can pay with a credit card.)<br>Schedule of Classes, explains Tele-BEARS in dry, functional language (Bear Student Store Textbooks; MLKJ Student Union; 642-0770). (New undergraduates get a free copy prior to their first semester; every semester thereafter, it's 50 cents. Cost is $6.00 plus tax for first-class mail. If you order a Catalog and Schedule at the same time, it would be $12.50 plus tax for both.) </dl><p><strong>The electronic Schedule of Classes</strong><br>It's an unfortunate fact of campus life that once the Schedule of Classes is printed, it gets more and more out of date as time goes on. Many departments change the times and/or the rooms of their courses after they've already been printed in the Schedule. What's a student to do? One solution is to use the "Review Class Time and Location" function of Tele-BEARS, but that may not always be convenient if you're on campus. Another solution is to use the Electronic Schedule of Classes which includes class limits and enrollment information. It's updated daily during peak periods, and you can do much more than look up a course. You can search for classes that meet certain criteria, such as all classes meeting at 10am. Need a 2-unit class? Use the Electronic Schedule to find all the 2-unit classes being given. Since it also provides course titles, you can also use the Electronic Schedule to find all classes on a particular subject.<p>You can find the Electronic Schedule under Infocal, Berkeley's information system, which is accessible from any computer or terminal connected to the campus network, as well as some terminals at campus libraries. You can also access the <a href="http://registrar.berkeley.edu:4202">Electronic Schedule</a> via the Office of the Registrar's Home Page on the WWW. In addition, there are two terminals in the main lobby of Sproul Hall directly connected to the Electronic Schedule. If you need information about connecting to the campus network from your computer at home, for informtaion <a href="#ESC">click here</a> or contact the Workstation Support Services Group (510/642-8899).<h3><hr noshade>Tele-BEARS dos and don'ts</h3><p><strong>Before your Tele-BEARS appointment</strong><br>Do be prepared! It's a good idea to plan several alternate schedules so you won't waste your time hunting through the Schedule of Classes or the General Catalog during your Tele-BEARS appointment. Remember, you have a ten minute time limit before Tele-BEARS automatically ends your call.<p>Do read the boring blurbs in the Schedule of Classes about adding specific courses. Certain classes have special requirements. You may need to submit a writing sample or call a special number to get into the class.<p>Do be aware of exam group conflicts; Tele-BEARS will not inform you if you have signed up for courses with the same exam groups. Most professors are not sympathetic to rearranging finals.<p>Don't worry about taking all your basic requirements your first semester. Many of these courses, such as Reading and Composition 1A classes, economics 1, political science 1, math and chemistry 1A, are overcrowded, so you may have to wait a semester or two anyway.<p>Do schedule courses back to back; classes start at 10 minutes after the hour (or half hour), so you'll usually have enough time to walk to the next building.<p>Do sign up for a variety of courses. For instance the Reading and Composition Requirement for L&S (and the English requirement for other colleges as well) can be met by classes from 10 different departments. Be adventurous and try African American Studies 1A or Dramatic Art 1B. (Check your College or School Announcement for all the options.) <p>Don't worry, it's okay to mix and match Reading and Composition Requirement classes. For example, you can take Rhetoric 1A in the fall and Asian American Studies 2B in the spring. <p>Do try to get some basic courses (like Reading and Composition 1A-1B type classes and math) and breadth requirements (see your College Announcement). Good classes include Freshman Seminar Program courses (because they're small seminars: check page 60), and classes which satisfy more than one requirement. <p>Don't take more than two classes with science labs or studio classes. These courses take more time than others, and you don't want to burn out.<p>Don't believe rumors about Mickey Mouse classes; astronomy 10, for instance, may be a cinch for someone with a science background, but some humanities-type majors will struggle to get a "C." Music 27 may be nicknamed "clapping for credit," but you'd better be musically inclined if you expect it to be easy.<p>Do choose a good teacher. They are everywhere, and some have received Distinguished Teaching Awards. You probably won't go wrong if you choose one of these people. (Distinguished professors have a dagger "†" after their names in the General Catalog.) Also, ask other students who they've enjoyed. (Check pages 94-99 for a list of classes taught by professors recommended by students.)<p>Do take advantage of the P/NP (pass/no pass) grading option, but check in your College Announcement for any requirement restrictions which may apply.<p>Do try to declare your major as soon as possible. Many upper division classes are restricted to major-only students. You won't get in if your major isn't declared.<p><hr><strong>During your Tele-BEARS appointment</strong><br>Don't be discouraged if a course you want is full. Get on the Waiting List right away! That's the only way you'll be able to enroll in the course.<p>Don't let that busy signal drive you crazy! One of the most important things to remember while using Tele-BEARS is to remain patient. If you get a busy signal, hang up and try again (in a few seconds, a couple of hours or even the next day). During your Phase I and II appointment times, you have a 24-hour period in which to adjust your schedule, and afterwards you have four open hours a day (M-F) to try and make schedule additions or changes. A phone that has a redial button can be your best friend!<p>Don't call Tele-BEARS unnecessarily, especially during the beginning of the Adjustment Period. You'll only be tying up a phone line and preventing another student from using the system. And, there is a 25 call limit per student during each Phase.<p>Don't call Tele-BEARS to check your status on an automatic waiting list until after the run date indicated in the Schedule of Classes. Nothing will happen to your status on the waiting list until after the automatic waiting lists have been run.<p>Don't forget to call Tele-BEARS during Phase II. This is the time when you can complete your schedule and add more units to reach your college or school's minimum.<p>Don't forget to pay your registration fees! <p>Do consider having your Confirmed Class Schedule (CCS) held at the Registrar's if you won't know your new address. Undergraduates in Business, Environmental Design, Natural Resources, and Optometry will have their CCS held in their school or college in any case.<p>Don't hog classes! Drop unwanted courses right away; this frees up space for other students who want to add them. You can use the special Tele-BEARS Drop-Hotline during the adjustment period.<p>Don't worry about getting all your courses before classes start. You'll still get your Cal Photo ID validation sticker even if you're enrolled in just one class. You have until the end of the Adjustment Period to enroll in your college or school minimum units.<p>Do use Info-BEARS to check for new and open course sections.<p><hr><strong>Class advice</strong> <br>Do go to the first meeting of classes you're already enrolled in--you may be dropped if you don't show up!<p>Don't neglect going to the classes you already have even if you don't think you want them. In case you aren't admitted to any new courses you're on the waiting list for, you'll still have backup classes.<p>Do go to the first meeting of classes for which you're on the waiting list; you'll get a better idea of your chances for enrolling.<p>Don't miss your first discussion session even if it is held before the first lecture because you may be dropped otherwise.<p>Do drop courses you don't want by the end of the second week of classes, so you can avoid the $10 per class drop fee.<p>Don't forget to add classes by the end of the third week of classes so you can avoid the $5 per class add fee.<p>Do come to the CalSO Resource Center (MLKJ Student Union) if you don't have classes or ones that you want to keep. CalSO counselors can help you find alternatives.<p><hr><strong>CalSO Resource Center</strong> <br>If you're confused by the Tele-BEARS system, in search of extra units, unfamiliar with adding and dropping classes, or just need some information about life as a Cal student, the CalSO Resource Center is available. The CalSO Resource Center can let you know which courses are still accepting student enrollment, if classes require a course entry code, and how many students are on a waiting list. The CRC is staffed by trained CalSO (Cal Student Orientation) counselors (in fall, open week prior to and during the first two weeks of classes; in spring, open week prior to and during the first week of classes; located in the lobby of MLKJ Student Union on the Bancroft Way side, near the Information Center; 642-2332 or 642-4970). <p><hr><strong>Checking your school records</strong> <p><strong>Info-BEARS</strong><br>Need to check your schedule? How about your grades for last semester? And, what about the status of your financial aid awards for next year? All this and more are available on Info-BEARS, Berkeley's information retrieval system. It works just like Tele-BEARS in that you need to use a touchtone telephone, and you have to enter your Student ID number and PIN. Unlike Tele-BEARS, you can't do any adds or drops to your class schedule, but you can hear important stuff like your final grades from the previous semester (remember, they aren't mailed to you) and information on your financial aid package for the school year. Info-BEARS can also help you plan your class schedule by informing you about which Reading and Composition or American Cultures classes still have openings, or whether new sections have been added in a course you want to take. You should make a habit of calling Info-BEARS periodically throughout the semester to check your class schedule (M-F, 7am-10pm; Sa, 7am-7pm; Su, noon-6pm; 642-9400).<a name="BearFacts"><p><strong>Bear Facts</strong></a><br>Think of Bear Facts as Info-BEARS on a computer screen. It provides a lot of the same information (including your class schedule, final grades [actually your entire transcript], financial aid, and billing information), but you access it via a personal computer instead of a telephone. Plus, you can even use Bear Facts to change your address. Right now, Bear Facts is available only in select computer stations on campus, but soon it will be available on the campus computer network so you will be able to access it from home using your Mac or PC and a modem.<p><strong>Bear Facts stations</strong> are currently located in the following areas:<br>Wheeler Hall Computing Lab,   room 211<br>Golden Bear Center Atrium<br>Golden Bear Center Computing Lab<br>Financial Aid Office, 220 Sproul<br>Graduate Division, 302 Sproul<br>Haas Business School Computing   Lab<br>Housing and Dining Services, 2401   Bowditch<br>Career and Graduate School   Services, 2111 Bancroft Way    <p><a name="Buying books and readers"><h3><hr noshade>Buying books and readers</h3></a><p>You can avoid long lines at the bookstore by buying books ahead of time. Just make sure you keep the receipt, and don't mark in the books until you're sure you have the class. By shopping early, you can also find used books, which are sold much cheaper than new ones. <p>To find required books for classes, go in the store and find the aisle where your subject is located, and the books will be marked according to classes.<p><a href="http://server.berkeley.edu/TBP/Textbooks/">UC Berkeley Used Textbook Exchange Services</a> is provided online by Tau Beta Pi.<p><hr><strong>The local textbook stores</strong><br>Books can usually be returned to bookstores through the end of the third week of classes, with a receipt. At the end of the semester most bookstores have a buyback period where you can resell your books for a percentage of the original price.<p>Buyback rate for books being used again:<br>Textbooks, 50% cover price<br>Trade books, 5-40% cover price<p>For books not being used again:<br>Wholesale, usually 5-40% cover price<p><strong>The Bear Student Stores Textbooks</strong><br>MLKJ Student Union, Garage level, 642-0770<br>M-Th, 9am-8pm<br>F, 9am-6pm<br>Sa, 10am-6pm<br>Su, noon-5pm<br>Open longer hours during the first week of classes<p><strong>Boalt Law Bookstore</strong><br>Boalt Hall, Bancroft Way and College Avenue, 540-7733<br>M-Th, 9:30am-4:30pm (closed from 2pm to 3pm)<br>F, 9:30am-3:30pm (closed from 2pm to 3pm)<p><strong>Campus Textbook Exchange (CTE)</strong><br>2470 Bancroft Way, 848-7700<br>M-Th, 8:30am-6pm<br>F, 8:30am-5pm<br>Sa, 10am-5pm <br>Su, 11am-5pm<br>First week of classes: M-Sa, 8am-8pm<br>Su, Noon-5pm<p><strong>Ned's Berkeley Bookstore</strong><br>2480 Bancroft Way, 204-0900<br>M-F, 9am-5pm<br>Sa-Su, 10am-5pm<p><strong>Revolution Books</strong><br>2425 Channing Way (in a mini-mall below Telegraph), 848-1196<br>M, closed<br>Tu-Sa, 11am-7pm<br>Su, 11-6<br>Many ethnic studies departments carry their books here.<p><hr><strong>Readers</strong> <br>Readers are a collection of copied ("Xeroxed") articles which professors assemble for course reading instead of, or in addition to, textbooks.

The Library's collections and services are complemented by a variety of campus special or "affiliated" libraries and departmental reading rooms.<p>The holdings of the University Library system include over 8 million volumes and 89,800 current serial titles. Most of the campus humanities and social sciences materials are located in Doe Library. Moffitt Library is designed as a core collection and entry point for new and undergraduate students.<p>Your current Cal Photo ID enables you to check out home-use materials from most of these libraries. You can also renew your own books by typing "HELP RENEW" on GLADIS. Please be sure to consult the "NEWS HOURS" screen on GLADIS, Berkeley's online (computer) catalog, for library hours. A map of the libraries and leaflets on a variety of topics about library use may be picked up at many library reference and information desks, or call the Information Desk in Doe Library (643-9999).<p><hr><strong>Moffitt Library</strong> <br>Moffitt is open more hours than most other libraries on campus and has more seating space for studying. A current Cal Photo ID is required to gain entry to the library. Moffitt is open most weeknights until 2am, and the Night Safety Shuttles can pick you up after dark. Self-guided orientation tours are available at the Moffitt Reference Desk (third floor, 642-5070). <p>24-hour study hall is usually available during final exams.<p><strong>The Term Paper Advisory Service (TPAS)</strong> librarians consult with students about papers (Moffitt Reference Desk; 643-9959). <p>Moffitt also offers "Research Assistant," an interactive computer instruction program which teaches the skills to write a successful term paper and do research in the library. If you're hooked to the campus network, you can find a copy of the program in the "library" folder. <p><a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/TeachingLib/About.html"><strong>The Teaching Library</strong></a> is aimed at increasing student success and information literacy by teaching the how tos of using a wide range of information resources including the Internet and the GLADIS and MELVYL online catalogs (302 Moffitt Library; tlib@library. berkeley.edu; 643-9959).<p><strong>Sample midterms and final exams</strong> for certain courses are on file in Moffitts's Closed Reserve stacks and at many other campus libraries; you must use the GLADIS online computer catalog (type in: FI TI EXAMS) to find out which exams are available. <p>An exam file is also kept in the ASUC Library (MLKJ Student Union, 642-2892).<p><hr><strong>Doe Library</strong> <br><strong>The General Reference Room</strong> of Doe Library has a large study area with beautiful oak tables and a decorated barrel ceiling. Self-guided tours of Doe may be checked out from the Reference Desk (Information Desk; Doe Library Loan Hall, second floor; 643-9999).<p><strong>The Morrison Room,</strong> located on the first floor of Doe Library, is a cozy haven for recreational reading and listening to music. In the fall, the University community can rent prints by famous artists for a minimal fee from the Graphic Arts Loan Collection (101 Doe Library; 642-3671).<p><strong>The Library Bookstore</strong> sells duplicate copies and superseded materials at very reasonable prices (M-Th, 11am to 2pm; 132 Doe Library).<p><strong>Lockers</strong> are available on the first floor of the Doe Library Annex. The lockers come in two sizes and the non-refundable fees are 50 cents and 25 cents. Lockers are cleared of their contents every Friday between 4pm and 5pm. The lockers are administered by the Library Copy Service (642-5994).<p><hr><strong>New attractions</strong> <br><strong>The underground addition to Doe Library,</strong> connecting the Doe and Moffitt Libraries, has 450 electrified work stations so you can use a laptop computer. There are three floors of bookstacks, each longer than a football field. The addition has 52 miles of shelving (which would stretch from Berkeley to San José!) and space for nearly 2,000,000 volumes. Two-thirds of the collection is on compact shelving so that more volumes can be housed on campus. There are also 18 small rooms in the east wing for group study, and some study carrels are reserved for graduate students. <p><strong>The Thomas J. Long Business and Economics Library</strong> is housed in the new Haas School of Business. It seats 300, and the collection focuses on business administration and economics. <p><strong>The Bioscience and Natural Resources Library</strong> in the Valley Life Sciences Building is now open and seats 350 with some study stations with outlets for your laptops. The library houses a drop-in microcomputer lab for your use, and a seminar room where you can take classes to learn to do research in the life sciences. The library also has comfortable study areas and two group study rooms.<p><strong>The Library Map Collection</strong> is currently housed in 40 Giannini Hall, pending its future move into McCone Hall, where it will join the Earth Sciences Library.<p><hr><strong>Finding what you want</strong> <br>The campus library system has several different online information systems you can check when looking for books, periodicals, and other information:<p><strong>GLADIS</strong> is the online computer catalog of Berkeley Library collections;<p><strong>MELVYL</strong> is the online computer system which contains catalog records for all nine UC campus library systems and a variety of other electronic databases; and<p><a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu"><strong>The UCB Library Web</strong></a> provides easy, 24-hour access to a variety of electronic resources such as the Encyclopedia Britannica, library catalogs, and thousands of reference and research resources throughout the world on the Internet. Use any Web browser (such as Netscape or NCSA Mosaic) to connect to the Library's website.<p><strong>Free Library Research Workshops</strong> are held several times during the semester to teach you how to use the online catalogs and the World-Wide Web effectively (643-9959).<p><strong>If you have a computer, a modem, and communications software,</strong> it's possible for you to access GLADIS and MELVYL from your home or residence hall! Leaflet #62 "Remote Access to Library Catalogs" is available from most of the campus libraries and explains hookup procedures. Dialup procedures are also available by typing "News Dialup" on GLADIS.<p><strong>Bibliography 1</strong> is a six week course where students learn how to explore one of the richest information treasures in the world and become confident and critical researchers through an introduction to Berkeley and University of California Libraries. Topics cover: search strategies; an introduction to online public catalogs (GLADIS and MELVYL); and print resources and electronic databases, including the Internet (Bib 1, Teaching Library; 643-9959).<p><hr><strong>Other libraries</strong> <br><strong>The ASUC Library</strong> is a quiet place to study with large tables. Food, beverages, and sleeping are allowed! The ASUC Library also houses the ASUC archives and is the information center for all ASUC student publications (M-F, 8:30am to midnight and Sa-Su, noon to midnight; closed during the summer; Heller Lounge; MLKJ Student Union; 642-2892).<p><a href="http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/bpl/"><strong>The Berkeley Public Library</strong></a> resources include CDs, videos, great music programs, the latest fiction and nonfiction, sheet music, tools (yes, tools!), community information (BIN, 540-0666), story hours for children, and it's all free (M-Th, 10am-9pm; F-Sa, 10am-6pm; and Su, 1pm-5pm; Central Branch, 2090 Kittredge Street at Shattuck; 644-6100). <p><a name="Lounge areas"><h3><hr noshade>Lounge areas</h3></a><p>In addition to the lounges we've listed below, most residence halls have spaces for hanging out or studying, but the use of these areas is generally restricted to residents. Many academic departments have a library, reading room, or lounge, and some of these areas are also restricted. Most are small rooms with tables, chairs, and couches, and are generally used for quiet reading or studying. We've put together a list of these under a section called More lounges on page 91. <p><strong>The Bear's Lair</strong> is filled with tables and chairs, both inside and outside. You can study if you want, but it's more of a social scene, so there's lots of chatter, music, and general noise (M-Th, 7am-11pm; F, 7am-2am; lower level MLKJ Student Union; 843-0373).<p><strong>Bridges Lounge</strong> is a spacious area filled with nice, comfortable couches and is ideal for everything but smoking (M-F, 8am-5pm; lower level Bechtel Engineering Center).<p><strong>Heller Study Lounge</strong> is a quiet place to study or read between classes. The lounge is spacious and outfitted with chairs and tables for your comfort and convenience. Eating and drinking are allowed (M-F, 8:30am-midnight; Sa-Su, noon to midnight; during finals it's open 24 hours; MLKJ Student Union).<p><strong>Also,</strong> you've surely seen all the cafes surrounding the campus. It's totally cool to buy one café latte and then monopolize a chair for two hours while you read your econ assignment. <p><a name="Copying services"><h3><hr noshade>Copying services</h3></a><p><strong>The Library Copy Service</strong> provides high-quality, competitively priced, over-the-counter photocopying facilities.

As soon as you possibly can--freshmen can often get in--talk yourself into at least one seminar or small class taught by a professor, even if it's upper division (or graduate), even if it's outside your field. Take Environmental Design 1 to get to know the campus better, and Bibliography 1 to learn how to use our monster library. Get to know and use the Morrison Room in the Doe Library, and the Rec Sports Facility, two of the greatest places on campus. Get cheap tickets to all the exotic events at Zellerbach Auditorium, to plays at the Playhouse and films at the PFA, and go to the free noon concerts at Hertz Hall. Support the Bears, win or lose. Don't believe everything you read in the Daily Cal. Consider joining a church group. You can learn as much in Berkeley's bookstores and cafes as you can in libraries and classes; pick your own favorites soon, and don't consider time spent in them as wasted. On that one perfect day every term, cut class and go to the pool, or lie on the grass in the sun. <dd>David Littlejohn, Professor<br>Journalism<p><dt>To get classes, don't give up. Be persistent. When I tried to register for impacted classes at the start of my freshman year, I was told "this class is full," and I didn't know what to do. I was so frustrated I nearly cried. But I've learned that if I juggle the times of the classes I want to register for, I'll get in. If I get on the waiting list and attend the first few class meetings, I'll get in. And I've learned to register for the most heavily impacted courses in Tele-BEARS Phase I to improve my chances of getting in. In short, creativity and planning will get you in the courses you want and need.<dd>Stacey Oziel, First year<br>Undeclared<p><dt>Since UC Berkeley is a public institution, students may not always get all the classes they want. Just keep on top of things and keep attending lectures and discussions, and you will get into most classes. And be smart when choosing what classes to enroll in during Phase I of Tele-BEARS. Always choose the most popular classes first. In any case, just keep fighting.<dd>Kien Don Lam, First year<br>Chemical Engineering<p><dt>I talk to students every week who say they didn't think it was any big deal to forge a grade change or turn in one borrowed, bought or stolen project or paper. After all, everyone cuts corners once in a while, right! What these students fail to realize is that academic dishonesty, whether it be the old fashioned sneaking notes into a test or the computer age wizardry of plagiarizing off the Internet, can get them suspended or dismissed from this University.<br>When I ask students "Are the few hours you saved by cheating worth losing a semester?" Inevitably, they answer, "No, I wish I wouldn't have done it!"<dd>Stacy Holguin, Student Conduct Officer<br>Student Activities and Services<p><dt>Before I came to Berkeley, I thought and anticipated being homesick since I'm the baby and all. And I've been homesick every time I've been away like this. However, I really don't miss home that much because I've built my own territory here and have friends and have grown to love Berkeley. I'm not homesick at all even though sometimes I do wish I could visit friends from home.<dd>Kelly Hai Wong, First year<br>Undeclared<p><dt>I thought that I'd be really homesick because I'm close to my family. However, I found new friends and activities in which to be involved. The homesickness never surfaced, and I've been enjoying the Berkeley atmosphere ever since.<dd>Emy Chen, First year<br>Molecular Cell Biology<p><dt>When I first arrived at Berkeley I thought I was going to die from being homesick. After the first month, independence becomes one of the greatest things to have for yourself.<dd>Denise Murphy, First year<br>Undeclared<p><dt>Don't set your hopes too high for anything here at Cal because if it doesn't meet your standards you'll be bummed and far away from home and friends. Just be yourself and always remember those things you value in life, you'll be fine here!<dd>Maritza Madrigal, Junior<br>Ethnic Studies<p><dt>Make friends with a librarian--they know how to find it all--cool web sites, infor-mation, money, archives, books, electronic resources!<dd>Ellen Meltzer, Head<br>Teaching Library<p><dt>There was a time when I was doing my girlfriend a favor by finding an article in the engineering library of the Bechtel building for her. Until then, I had never been to the north side of campus. I had no clue where to find such an article; the reference librarian was very patient to the clueless Dramatic Art major who thought engineering majors wanted to drive trains. Anyway, she was very helpful in my search for the article. I thank her to this day.<dd>Forrest G. Hartl, Junior<br>Dramatic Art<p><dt>Morrison Library is the most beautiful room on campus. As a Conservation and Resource/Political Science major, "homework" often consists of reading a bunch of wonderful books. It's great being able to study on a comfy couch with my legs propped up and listening to the Bangles. It's my escape from my messy hole of a room and the usual sterile library situation.<dd>Teri Tsang, First year<br>Conservation and Resource/Political Science<p><dt>Make friends with people who will go to the library with you to study; you'll not only spend time with your friends, get your homework done, but the walk back from the library is great!<dd>Fei Cha, First year<br>American Studies/Mass Communications<p><dt>When I first started at Cal I was without a computer for two weeks and was forced to use the lab at Dwinelle. I was absolutely impressed. The student workers were extremely helpful and patient. I discovered e-mail, which I'm totally addicted to now, and overall I was very happy with the facilities that Cal offers.<dd>Cathy Tellis, Junior<br>English<p><dt>For information on lots of different topics and activities at Berkeley check the UC Berkeley Homepage to learn about various campus groups, classes, and employment opportunities. You can do this with a free computer account at any of the campus computing facilities. Address: "http:www.berkeley.edu"<dd>Leslie F. Stone, Senior<br>Political Economy of Industrial Societies<p><dt>A very helpful department is the computing consulting office on the second floor of Evans Hall. They can answer almost any type of computer question and they distribute Berkeley IP kits for Mac and Windows 3.1. They also just recently helped get rid of a virus on my computer.<dd>Peter Fong, Sophomore<br>Mechanical Engineering<p><dt>Before, I thought that working hard and putting a lot of effort into a subject would be fruitful in the end. I learned now that if one's not academically compatible, no matter how hard you try (or how much effort one puts in), you may not get what you expected in the end.<dd>Cheng Boey Lau, First year<br>Chemical Engineering<p><dt>Academics is what Berkeley is known for. However, it is much different than high school. At Berkeley more of an in-depth analysis as well as applications of concepts are required for success. Also try to stay ahead in your reading, it will only help you!<dd>Paul Redondo, First year<br>Molecular and Cell Biology<p><dt>One way to get through the work is to meet others who are doing what you are doing. They will serve as an inspiration and become a support system. It's impor-tant to network and make friends with students, staff, and professors in and out of your field of interest. They will be a shoulder to lean on when things get rough during your college years.<dd>Kim Smeaton, Senior<br>Psychology<p><dt>The competition here is fierce. You think you're smart because you took 6 APs. Nope, you'll meet people who got 1600s and took every single AP offered. I've discovered that to survive here, you need to study pretty much all day.<dd>James Chen, First year<br>Molecular and Cell Biology<p><dt>Before I came to Berkeley, I had heard horror stories about how cutthroat the academic competition was. In reality though, the students and faculty here are all very willing to help out.<dd>Amy Fang, First year<br>Undeclared<p><dt>College is a place to learn and improve oneself, it is not a place to be caught up in unhealthy competition. The classroom is the environment for you to appreciate knowledge and understand, it's not a place to merely stuff information down your throat. Classmates are there to be your partners and friends in the journey of seeking truth, they are not lions and tigers, who threaten your personal success.<dd>Matty Chen, First year<br>Industrial Engineering and Operation Research<p><dt>Cal is much harder than I  thought at first. The key is not to let yourself relax for a second, because once you do, there's no bringing yourself back up.<dd>Joyce Luk, First year<br>Chemistry<p><dt>As a student who came in during the spring semester, I always thought that I was second class because the University didn't want me in the fall. I had to overcome my thoughts of infer-iority and intimidation. At the end of my first semester, my GPA was around 3.48, and I then realized that I am fully capable of competing with students at Berkeley even though I was accepted in spring. That is the most important thing to keep in mind--spring students are just as intellectually strong as fall students. Never forget this.<dd>Jason Kung, Sophomore<br>Undeclared<p><dt>Berkeley is not a hard institution! It just takes a lot of time to keep up with your readings and to concentrate in class.<dd>Dawit Mekonnen, Junior<br>Molecular and Cell Biology<p><dt>The Student Learning Center provides excellent tutorial services. At first, I was wary of going there because I felt that the people who needed tutors were people who were slow at grasping information. But I tried it when I took a science class because I needed help on a few homework problems, and I ended up going there every week. Most of the students there were already doing well in the class, but needed additional help in a few areas. The tutors are there to help you in anyway; either explaining concepts or helping you on a problem.<dd>Nitya Venkateswaran, Sophomore<br>Political Science<p><dt>I did very well when I was in high school, often getting straight As. Before I came to Berkeley, I didn't truly realize the difficulty of the courses here. Although I eventually realized that and started to get some tutorial help, sometimes it was still hard because, for example, the Student Learning Center doesn't offer tutoring in every subject (i.e. higher-level math, computer science courses). I would advise all new students to form study groups with their classmates. You learn the best when you discuss the course materials with those who are also learning them at the same time. And remember, this is a mighty and academically competitive University. The fact that you might have troubles in your courses is normal. Always get help whenever you need to. Be aggressive and positive. Look inside yourself and always have faith!<dd>Johnson Wu, First year<br>General Engineering Science</dl><p> Go to:<br><a href="r96ToC.html"><STRONG>Resource table of contents</STRONG></a><br><a href="r5Findinghelp.html"><STRONG>Next chapter</STRONG></a><br><a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/"><STRONG>UC Berkeley Home Page</STRONG></a>
