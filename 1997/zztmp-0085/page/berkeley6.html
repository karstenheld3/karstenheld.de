The GA elects three Officers and the other members of the Executive Committee (Anthony Hall; 642-2175). <p>There are two aspects to the GA's mission. First, the GA is charged with giving voice to graduate student concerns, both on the Berkeley campus and at the statewide level. Second, in addition to providing representation for graduate students, the GA also offers services designed to improve their experience of graduate school. These services include programs that fund graduate student projects; offer advice and counseling for women and minority students; distribute important information to the graduate student community; and assist all graduate students with especially difficult or unusual problems. <p>In serving graduate students the GA takes special care to provide advocacy on those issues inadequately addressed elsewhere in the campus community including student fees and financial aid, the rights of graduate student employees, student and faculty diversity, sexual and racial harassment, student housing, childcare for student parents, and student health coverage. <p>GA programs:<br>Graduate Minority Student Project (GMSP)<br>Graduate Women's Project (GWP)<br>Educational Improvement Grant Program (EIGP)<br>New Graduate Student Orientation (NGSO)<br>Department Liaison (DL)<p>Graduate students interested in subscribing to an e-mail list distributing important information should send a message to the GA's e-mail account: ga_ucb@uclink2.berkeley. edu.<dl><dt>Publications include:<dd>The Berkeley Graduate, a general magazine for graduate students<br>Diversity and Excellence: Graduate Students of Color Handbook <br>Learning to Teach: A Guide for Teaching Assistants<br>Teaching at Berkeley: A Guide for Foreign Teaching Assistants<br>Beyond the Barriers, a magazine for minority students</dl><p><hr><strong>Educational Career Services</strong><br>Graduate students who plan careers in education, either as faculty members or administrators, will find help at the Educational Career Services.

Assistance is available individually and in groups, on a drop-in basis or by appointment. Contact Michael Hardie (Office of Educational Development; 403 Sproul Hall; MTHOED@uclink. berkeley.edu; 642-6392). <p><hr><strong>Confusing titles</strong><br><strong>Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) or Teaching Assistant (TA)</strong><br>The two titles refer to the same thing. The Berkeley campus combined "Teaching Assistant" and "Teaching Associate" into one title, "Graduate Student Instructor." This title streamlines graduate student teaching appointments by consolidating them under one title with four salary levels. Keep this in mind when you see flyers for workshops for GSIs and TAs: they are intended for the same audience.<p><strong>Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) and Research Assistant (RA)</strong><br>Again, the title of Graduate Student Researcher replaced the old titles of Research Assistant, Postgraduate Researcher, and Junior/Assistant Specialist.

To maximize your Berkeley experience, take an assertive stand and look into programs offered through your department or major. This guide will give you some essential tools to survive. Pay careful attention to these sections: Majors, Career and Graduate School Services, Student organizations, and Re-entry students. (Check the Index, page 112.) <p><strong>Support</strong><br><strong>The Transfer Student Association (TSA)</strong> is an ASUC student-initiated service group, which serves the needs of 1500 new transfer students.<p>TSA does community college outreach in the Bay Area and offers a one-on-one "Day at Cal." A prospective transfer student follows an enrolled student for a day, seeing what classes are really like, meeting new people, and getting an in-depth tour of the campus. For new students there's the New Transfer Student Orientation in early fall semester where you can ask questions, meet new people, and learn about TSA. And, once new transfers have started school, TSA hosts social events like trips to San Francisco, picnics, and pizza nights, as well as academic events like graduate school advising, career planning, and résumé writing workshops. TSA also has a buddy program where a new student is paired with a continuing transfer student who shows the new student the ropes.<p>Since the group was established in the summer of 1990, one of TSA's biggest accomplishments has been the designation of specific residence hall buildings as transfer student residences. This way, transfer students have the option to live with other "older" students.<p>If TSA doesn't have the answer, they'll help you find it (316 Eshleman Hall; 642-8151).<p><strong>The Transfer Student Advisory Council</strong> identifies issues specific to transfer students and underrepre-sented groups and makes recommendations to AAD and the Assistant Vice Chancellor of Educational Development.

The Disabled Students' Program (DSP) helped me make my transition to Cal less painful. From them I got services such as academic advising, attendant referrals, note-takers for my classes and a sense of belonging which is very important for every new student here. <dd>Joanna Fraguli, Senior<br>Psychology/Sociology<p><dt>When you come to Cal, you'll probably have a lot of questions about school, about settling in, and maybe about how to get involved with the queer community here. One really helpful way to do this is to enroll in some of the classes for the new Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies Minor. This can really help involve you in these issues as well as provide a space to learn more.<dd>Joanna Friesner, Junior<br>Molecular and Cell Biology<p><dt>There are a diverse number of campus-sponsored academic and social groups, but having specific groups that serve the GLBTQ (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, questioning) community is truly an asset here at Cal.  There is always someone available to give guidance and reassurance to those who are still "questioning" and encouragement to those who are already "out."<dd>Danny Mariano, Senior<br>Architecture<p><dt>Get everything in writing with your landlord, even if you're renting a room from the nicest person ever. Oral rental agreements are not worth the paper they're written on (ha-ha). Also, don't waste time looking for housing too early. Landlords never advertise for vacancies more than 30 days in advance of availability, so don't look for August housing in February!<dd>Becky White<br>Assistant Director Community Living, Housing & Dinning Services<p><dt>I believe the keys to success for re-entry students are:<br>1. Setting realistic goals and prioritizing them.<br>2. Pooling resources, seeking out support systems.<br>3. Stress, time, and financial management.<br>At least, these were critical skills and services that helped me as a re-entry student parent.<dd>Queta Vargas, Adviser<br>Student Life Advising Services<p><dt>Cal can be very challenging for many students. Buy your books before the semester starts and start reading before classes begin. You must plan ahead to stay ahead.<dd>Stafford Johnson, Counselor<br>Student Life Advising<p><dt>When I first came to Cal, I had no friends for the first two weeks. My roommate was a sophomore who had already established herself. Instead of moping around in my dorm  room--where I certainly wouldn't find friends--I pushed myself to attend events where I could find people. Make sure you take every opportunity available, and don't mope! I found my best friend walking to the Step Show Fall '92--just talk to people! All freshmen are in the same boat.<dd>Norinne Bell, Senior<br>History<p><dt>For those worried about making it at a huge University like Berkeley, here is a tip.
