The Berkeley campus can seem confusing! With over 30,000 students, 11,500 faculty and staff, new construction and building renovations, unfamiliar policies and procedures, you may feel a little out of kilter during your first few weeks here! Besides Resource, the University sponsors orientation and information programs that will help you discover the variety of experiences, activities, and services available at Berkeley.<a name="Orientations"><h3>Orientations</h3></a>The orientations we're about to describe are the biggest programs; however, many departments, units, and student groups, which address particular student needs, also offer programs. These separate programs usually occur during the early weeks of each semester and in the past have included special orientations for African American, American Indian, Asian Pacific American, Chicano/Latino, disabled, gay, immigrant, re-entry, transfer, and international students. Information on all orientation programs is available through the Office of New Student Programs, the people who bring you Resource (642-4970).<p><strong>The Cal Student Orientation (CalSO) Program</strong> introduces new freshmen, their parents, and transfer students to the Berkeley campus through its summer and fall orientation programs. CalSO counselors (trained undergraduates) lead new students in small groups through a CalSO program where they receive academic advising and help with class selection; go on campus tours, learn about student services and co-curricular activities; and begin meeting some of their fellow classmates. In addition, new students participate in workshops and discussion sections on non-academic concerns such as substance abuse, multicultural awareness, and campus safety.<p>Continuing Cal students may apply to be <a href="http://www2.uga.berkeley.edu/uga/osl/nsp/nsp1_www.html">CalSO counselors</a> in mid-fall semester for the following summer (New Student Programs; 137 Golden Bear Center; 642-4970).<p><strong>New Graduate Student Orientation</strong> is sponsored by the Graduate Assembly (GA). This day-long orientation for all new graduate students provides information on every aspect of the graduate-student experience, from coping with heavy workloads to making good use of free time, from exploring the library system to negotiating the financial aid process, from understanding the computer facilities to getting help with personal problems (Anthony Hall; ga_ucb@uclink2.berkeley.edu; 642-2175).<p><hr><a href="http://www2.uga.berkeley.edu/new"><strong>Fall Welcome Week activities</strong></a><br>All incoming undergraduates are invited to Welcome Week, an extension of the CalSO Program, from Monday August 19 through Friday August 23. Five full days of activities ranging from academic programs to entertainment events give you a more extensive look at campus services and departments. These welcome events kick-off the Chancellor's "Smooth Transition" program for all new students. A calendar of activities, some extending through the first few weeks of classes, will be available at the Information Center after August 12, 1996 (main lobby, Martin Luther King, Jr. [MLKJ] Student Union; 642-INFO). <p>Students living in University residence halls will automatically get a copy of the calendar. More information about the welcome events will be sent to new undergraduates in early August (New Student Programs; 137 Golden Bear Center; 642-4970).<p><strong>The residence halls</strong> organize special activities for new residents during Welcome Week. Programs include Parent Orientations, campus tours, Academic Center open houses, campus safety and diversity awareness programs, movie nights, academic tips, and other informational and fun events. When students move into their residence hall, they will receive a Welcome Week Packet which includes information about the residence halls, telephone services, Cal Photo IDs, and other important campus and community resources (Residential and Family Living; 642-3213).<p><strong>The Daily Cal</strong> begins each fall and spring semester with a special orientation issue which features student views of campus services and Bay Area activities (600 Eshleman Hall; 548-8300).<a name="General information"><h3><hr noshade>General information</h3></a><p><strong>The Information Center</strong><br>The Information Center provides campus, transportation, and entertainment information; referrals for counseling and advising services; faculty, staff, and student directory listings; campus literature; help with registration procedures; and a Student Union lost and found (M-F, 8am-5pm and Sa; 10am-4pm; upper level, MLKJ Student Union; 642-INFO or 642-3361).<p><hr><strong>Tours</strong><br><a href="http://www.urel.berkeley.edu/urel_1/VisitorsCenter/visitor.html"><strong>The Visitor Information Center</strong></a> answers questions about the campus and conducts tours for individuals and groups. Open tours begin at 10am and 1pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Saturday tours are scheduled periodically throughout the year; please call for dates and times.

The first card is free: replacement cards cost $10. Validations stickers for previously issued cards will be mailed along with your Confirmed Class Schedule, provided you are a registered student. To find out about getting your picture taken for an ID card, stop by the Cal Photo ID Office, (open weekdays, 10am-noon and 1pm-3pm; 26 Sproul Hall; orreg@uclink. berkeley.edu; 642-8912).<a name="Pay your fees"><h3><hr noshade>Pay your fees</h3><p><strong>The Loans and Receivables Office</strong> bills and collects charges for student expenses, including registration fees and housing and dining charges, through the Campus Accounts Receivables System (CARS).

Berkeley is the ideal place to become the best person that you can be. Get involved! Participate in activities and programs that will help expose you to a variety of experiences that life and Berkeley has to offer.<dd>La Dawn DuVall Davis, Assistant Director<br>Visitor Information Center<p><dt>Ultimately education is what the matriculated student has left long after he or she has forgotten books read, courses taken and, alas, favorite no less than forgettable professors. Contributing to that education is not only classroom instruction but the total college experience: the struggle to get classes, handling the workload, adjusting to campus and community life, making friends, dealing with peers in competitive academic environments, dealing with professors (who many of you will come to suspect--justifiably--are no less fallible than yourselves), and, of course, separating the mythical Cal from the living, functioning Cal. Experience it all, eagerly and enthusiastically. Don't let your education be something that happens to you while you're doing something else--like complaining about it and trying to escape it.<dd>Harry Edwards, Professor<br>Sociology</dl><p> Go to:<br><a href="r96ToC.html"><STRONG>Resource table of contents</STRONG></a><br><a href="r3Gettingsituated.html"><STRONG>Next chapter</STRONG></a><br><a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/"><STRONG>UC Berkeley Home Page</STRONG></a>
