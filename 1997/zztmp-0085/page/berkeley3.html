If you're unfamiliar with Berkeley, you may wish to move into organized group housing near campus. If you're not going to stay in one of the group living situations, then you should plan to spend a week or so looking for a rental in the community. While you're looking for housing during the summer, you may stay at the Summer Visitor Housing. This facility offers single and double occupancy to visitors and guests (http://www.reshall.berkeley. edu/calstyle; Conference Services, 2601 Warring Street; 642-4444 or 642-5925). <p><strong>The Community Living Office</strong> provides rental listings (shared housing, vacant apartments and houses, and room/work exchanges) which are updated daily and are available for students to view either by examining the posted listings or by purchasing customized printouts at the office. The Community Living Office has counselors who can help you with your housing search as well as explain your rights and responsibilities as a good tenant. To get started, simply present your current Cal Photo ID or your letter of admission plus a photo ID, at the Community Living Office (M-F, 10am to 4pm; two blocks from campus at 2405 Bowditch Street; 642-3642).<p>All new undergraduate students should have received a Housing Brochure with their letter of admission. This publication explains all housing options in detail. If you didn't get one, or you need a new one, contact Housing and Dining Services (2401 Bowditch Street, Berkeley, CA 94720; 642-4108). <p>Organized group living situations are a great way to meet other students and to participate in a living and learning environment that will enhance your college experience. The Housing Brochure describes these group living options:<BLOCKQUOTE>University Residence Halls, aka dorms (2401 Bowditch, 642-4108)<p>Theme Programs (African American, Asian Pacific American, Italian, Mexican/Chicano, and Slavic, 2401 Bowditch, 642-3213)<p>Family Student Housing (2401 Bowditch Street, 642-4109)<p>Graduate Student Apartments (2401 Bowditch; 642-4109)<p>Casa Joaquin Murieta (2336 Piedmont Avenue, 540-1984)<p>Co-ops, The University Students' Co-operative Association (USCA, 2424 Ridge Road, 848-1936)<p>International House (I-House, 2299 Piedmont Avenue, 642-9470)<p>Fraternities (643-6919)<p>Sororities (643-6916)</BLOCKQUOTE><p><hr><strong>More information about living in the University residence halls</strong><br>You probably have a lot of questions, and here are a few tips. <p>Be sure to read carefully all the housing information that is sent to you. The materials will contain deadline dates, fee information, and policies and procedures.<p>When you receive your contract offer for housing, you will also be given a booklet that describes the terms and conditions of living in the residence halls. Be sure to read it thoroughly before signing and returning your contract.<p>Once Housing and Dining Services receives your signed contract and deposit, they will send a welcome packet that includes the following information: a contract receipt, move-in dates, room furnishings, items to bring, and public transportation. Roommate information will be mailed to new students approximately ten days before move-in. (There may be some exceptions such as when a student does not want their name and phone number to be released.)<p>Avoid sending boxes to the residence halls before you arrive because they will either be lost or returned to you. Plan to have your boxes arrive during the week you move into the residence halls. In the meantime, just bring the things that you need: 1-2 week's worth of clothing, toiletry items, linen, a desk lamp, and a radio/alarm clock.<p>Many students have televisions and stereos in their rooms. The best thing to do is to wait until you talk to your roommate and decide who will bring what items. Refrigerator rentals will also be available during move-in week.<p>Residence halls provide students with more than a roof over their heads. The Academic Center gives residents access to computers, tutoring, advising, courses, study skills workshops, and faculty programs, such as the Last Lecture Series where professors deliver their hypothetical "last" lecture.<dl><dt><strong>Publications include:</strong><dd>Applications for: Cal Diners Club, A La Carte, Manville Apartments, Family Housing<br>Housing, brochure sent in your admissions packet<br>Terms and Conditions of Residence, sent with your contract<br>Arriving, Welcome, and Parking pamphlets sent with your contract receipt<br>Guide to Student Living in the Residence Halls, handed out at check-in</dl><p><hr><strong>Housing advocacy</strong><br>Occasionally students experience problems with rentals or living situations which require information and counseling services. <p><strong>The Attorney for Students</strong> is available to give legal advice at no charge to currently enrolled students (102 Sproul Hall; 642-4980). <p><strong>The Renters' Legal Assistance (RLA)</strong> offers counseling and assistance on all rental problems; education, outreach, and public interest research on state and local laws which have an impact on student renters; and a library. Internships are also available (314 Eshleman Hall; 642-1755). <p><strong>A Residential Life Committee</strong> promotes cooperative efforts among University-related residence groups, faculty exchanges, education programs, conflict conciliation, and resource sharing (102 Sproul Hall; 642-7950). <p> <hr><strong>Recycling</strong><br><strong>The ASUC Recycling Project,</strong> a student-initiated and collectively-run program, works on diverting 25% of Cal's waste from landfill; presently they collect 10%. Public bins for newspaper, glass, and aluminum are located on upper and lower Sproul Plaza, Hearst Mining Circle, Dwinelle Plaza, and outside of Wurster Hall. Recycling bins can also be found in most buildings on campus and in the laundry rooms of residence halls. Paid positions for collectors and coordinators are available; interns and volunteers are welcome. For more information, contact the Recycling Project or attend one of the weekly meetings at six o'clock on Wednesday evenings (504 Eshleman Hall; 642-4895).<p><strong>Other community resources</strong><br><strong>Recycling Hotline:</strong> Provides information about curbside pickup in the Bay Area (M-F, 8:30am-4:30pm; 527-5555).<p><strong>The Berkeley Recycling Center</strong> Buyback and The Drop-off will buy aluminum and glass and will accept newspaper, tin cans, and junk mail (Tu-Su, 9am-4pm; Gilman Street and Second Street in Berkeley; 524-5355 or 524-0113).<p><strong>The Community Conservation Center</strong> (daily, 9am-5pm; Martin Luther King, Jr. Way, at Dwight, in Berkeley; 524-5355 or 524-0113).<p><strong>The Ecology Center</strong> has information about recycling, including motor oil disposal, in Alameda and Contra Costa counties (Tu-Sa, 11am-5pm; 2530 San Pablo Avenue; 548-2220).<p><hr><strong>Mailing services</strong><br><strong>The Sather Gate Post Office</strong> is a block south of campus (M-F, 9am-5pm and Sa, 10am-1:30pm; sort of hidden at 2515-1/2 Durant Avenue above Telegraph; 649-3152).<p><strong>The Berkeley Main Post Office</strong> accepts passport applications (M-F, 8:30am-4:30pm; room 109) and has window and lobby (vending machine) service (M-F, 8:30am-6pm, and Sa, 10am-2pm; 2000 Allston Way; 649-3100).<p><strong>The Postal Answer Line</strong> answers questions regarding post office hours and locations, mail rates, delivery times, stamp collecting, or just about anything involving the US Postal Service (24 hours daily; 268-8871, touchtone phone calls only). For zip code information call 251-3300.<p><hr><strong>Banking</strong><br>There are a lot of banks and savings and loans on the south and west sides of campus. If you're currently banking with a large institution, chances are they'll have a Berkeley branch. ATMs near campus accept Cirrus, Plus, Star, and GlobalAccess system bankcards as well as American Express, MasterCard and Visa credit cards.<p><strong>CUBS (Credit Union for Berkeley Students)</strong> is a full service, federally insured financial institution. The Credit Union offers all registered UC Berkeley students free checking, ATM access, consumer and student loans, a low APR VISA with no annual fee, and many other special member services (MTuW F, 1-5pm; lower Sproul Plaza, MLKJ Student Union; 883-0517).<p><strong>Credit Cards</strong><br>If you are like most new students and have not established credit, the Bear Student Store sponsors a variety of special programs designed to give you credit. Representatives from banks and card issuers can assist you in filling out an application from their tables outside the Bear Student Store (Bancroft entrance; 642-7010). <p><hr><strong>Out of towners</strong><br><strong>Area Code:</strong> 510. This code serves customers in Alameda and Contra Costa counties: basically, the East Bay. The 415 area code serves San Francisco and Marin counties.<p><strong>Drinking age:</strong> 21.<p><strong>Residency:</strong> If you don't want to pay the extra non-resident tuition in future years, contact the Residence Matters office. You need to begin establishing your intent to become a California resident as soon as you get here (39 Sproul Hall; 642-1614). <p><strong>Time:</strong> Call "POP-CORN" (767-2676) to find out what time it is.<p><a href="http://www.nws.mbay.net/home.html#Current"><strong>Weather:</strong></a> Have you heard Mark Twain's quote, "The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco"? The weather in Berkeley is fairly moderate all year long. On a typical summer day, the fog doesn't burn off until late morning and rolls back in during the evenings; sometimes you'll need a sweater. Fall is warm; September and October are the hottest months of the year. People wear shorts until the cold snap in November, and we get excited when we see a few red and yellow maple leaves. During any given winter month, you'll need a muffler, shorts, or an umbrella. And during the spring, you'll get a little bit of everything. For recorded official local daily forecasts you can call the National Weather Service at 936-1212.<p><strong>Voter registration:</strong> applications can be picked up at any post office, public library, or fire station, or you can have one mailed to you by the Registrar of Voters (1225 Fallon Street, Oakland; 272-6973 or 1-800-834-6454). <p>This is another good step to take to establish California residency for tuition purposes.<p>Check the Index for information on earthquakes and driver's licenses.<p><hr><strong>The City of Berkeley</strong><br><strong>Berkeley City Hall:</strong> City Clerk's Office, 2180 Milvia Street, 644-6480.<p><strong>Berkeley Convention and Visitors Bureau Information Hotline:</strong> 549-8710.<p><strong>Berkeley residential area parking permits:</strong> 2180 Milvia, 644-6470.<p><strong>Berkeley's Southside neighborhood</strong><br>"Southside" is one of Berkeley's most popular neighborhoods for student living and includes residence halls, fraternities, sororities, co-ops, and many private apartments. Telegraph Avenue is fun and busy with cafes, restaurants, stores, and street vendors, plus Telegraph Area Association-sponsored events like Sunday Street Fairs, a Farmer's Market, and the Berkeley Jazz Festival. <p>Because the Southside area houses many students, the quality of life there is of prime importance to the University. The University, the City of Berkeley, and members of the community are working in partnership on a broad-ranging neighborhood revitalization effort. The result has been reduced crime, improved social services, upgraded street cleaning and graffiti removal, and funding for new lighting, trees, and other amenities. <p>Students can get involved in the Southside by joining the Telegraph Area Association or through campus programs like Cal-in-Berkeley (page 64) and Cal Corps agencies (page 65). For more information contact the Telegraph Area Association (649-9500) or the UC Community Affairs Office (642-7860).<dl><dt>Publications include:<dd>Telegraph Lines, newsletter about neighborhood issues and events</dl><p><a name="Eating"><h3><hr noshade>Eating</h3></a><p><strong>Housing and Dining Services</strong><br>The Department of Housing and Dining Services manages six campus restaurants and six residence hall dining rooms. <p>In most residence halls three meals are served daily Monday through Friday, with hours varying slightly among the different units:<dl><dd><br>Breakfast, 7:15am-10am<br>Brunch, 10:30am-1pm<br>Lunch, 11am-1:15pm<br>Dinner, 5pm-7pm</dl><dt>On weekends and holidays two meals are served daily in most units:<dl><dd>Brunch, 11am-1pm<br>Dinner, 5pm-6:30pm<br>Bag lunches to go and late or early dinners may also be requested.</dl><p>Students living in the residence halls or off campus have a variety of dining plan options to choose from. <p><strong>The On Campus Option</strong> is a supplement to the residence hall meal plan contract and offers an increased meal value when students visit the campus restaurants. <p><strong>The A La Carte Dining Card</strong> is a prepaid, discounted debit card available to all students, staff, and faculty and is accepted at both campus restaurants and residence halls. <p><strong>The Cal Diners' Club</strong>, a dining plan created especially for students (and faculty and staff) living off campus, offers a choice of up to 19 meals a week in any of the residence hall dining locations (2401 Bowditch Street; 642-1524).<p><strong>Residence Hall Dining Facilities</strong> are located at Units 1, 2, and 3, Foot-hill, Bowles, and at the Clark Kerr Campus residence hall complex. <p><hr><strong>Campus-operated restaurants</strong><br>These restaurants are closed on weekends, and hours are subject to change.

All Berkeley students and their spouses or domestic partners can use the UHS. (Spouses and domestic partners pay additional fees.) The UHS is subsidized by your registration fees, and there are also some charges for services. Fees charged are not to make a profit, just to support the service. Payment plans are available. Though the UHS does not provide children's or dental services, they do offer insurance coverage and can provide community referrals.<p>Students enrolled for summer session pay a health fee which entitles them to out-patient medical care during the session. After the session is over, they may use the health services on a fee-for-service basis. <p>Take the time to get to know the UHS staff and services while you're at Cal. Ask questions, especially if the UHS is different from your previous health-care tradition. By taking an active role in your own health, you can help the UHS help you (Tang Center; 2222 Bancroft Way, on the southwestern edge of campus; 642-2000).<p><strong>Medical Care and Clinical Services</strong><br><strong>Appointment and general UHS information</strong><br>Trained and licensed physicians, nurse practitioners, and nurses perform exams, provide treatment, prescribe medications, and discuss prevention in four clinics covering general medicine, gynecology, and occupational health.

Professionals in public health and health education can teach you how to maintain a healthy lifestyle and healthy environment, and they can help address academic and other problems which arise from medical issues. Students are also key members of the team, acting as peer educators, volunteers, and interns.<p><strong>Health Promotion Outreach</strong> staff and peer educators provide training and education, free brochures, and consultations to assess health conditions of student environments such as living centers or social settings. The Self-Care Resource Library has interactive computer programs, videos, books, audio tapes, and other materials to help you check out health topics (642-7202). <p>Health promotion staff also teach undergraduate courses in individual, social, and political aspects of health (co-sponsored with the School of Public Health) and offer opportunities for volunteering and community service.<p><strong>Self-Care Resource Center</strong> is a health information library and resource center which offers computer programs, books, pamphlets, magazines and journals, article files, video and audio tapes, self-assessment tools, displays, and information on the UHS (M-F, 11am-3pm; second floor). <p><strong>Education programs</strong> include stress management, HIV/AIDS, back care, nutrition consultation, and alcohol and drug assessments and referrals.

You can buy the University plan and/or have your own private insurance. Students are automatically enrolled in SHIP (Student Health Insurance Plan) administered by the UHS. The semester fee is included in your registration bill: fall payment covers August 1 through December 31 and spring payment covers January 1 through July 31. There is a deductible, and coverage is good anywhere in the world. SHIP members can also purchase a separate health insurance policy for a spouse or domestic partner and dependents.<p>SHIP members must receive prior authorization from the UHS for off-campus care. Students requiring off-campus emergency care should call the UHS Student Health Insurance Office the next working day to request authorization. Please refer to a SHIP brochure for more information.<p>Students who already have comparable insurance can waive out of SHIP. The waiver process must be completed yearly. If you miss the date for filing waiver forms, you'll have to pay the insurance fee. Some students want to carry two insurance plans or can't figure out which plan is better. Call the UHS, they'll help you figure it out (UHS Student Health Insurance Office; third floor, room 3200; 642-5700).<p>Insured students should know the following about their private coverage: the insurance company's name and address, dates of coverage, insurance group number, individual ID, and the name on the policy. SHIP members should pick up their insurance cards at the UHS Insurance Office.<p><hr><a href="http://spectacle.berkeley.edu/"><strong>Optometry Clinics</strong></a><br>The School of Optometry offers complete vision care services to the campus community as part of its academic programs.

The University helps promote Berkeley Cares and students are invited to participate (Berkeley Cares; 845-4629; or UC Community Affairs Office; 642-7860). <p><strong>Volunteer organizations</strong> such as Cal Corps and Stiles Hall offer opportunities for students to work with the local homeless population.<p><hr><strong>Cult awareness</strong><br>If you feel alone or lonely, you may be vulnerable to cults that recruit regularly on college campuses. You can get help and advice, including information and referrals on cults and cult-related counseling, a slide show, and brochure from Student Activities and Services (102 Sproul Hall; 642-6772).<p><hr><a href="http://garnet.berkeley.edu:4254/oepweb/homepage.htm"><strong>Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP)</strong></a><br>The Berkeley campus is a great place to learn. But like any community it is vulnerable to unexpected events. In recent years the campus has been affected by the Loma Prieta Earthquake (October 1989) and the Oakland/Berkeley Hills Fire (October 1991). The Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP) educates the Berkeley campus community on how to prepare for major emergencies and recover from them. OEP activities include distributing informational brochures and posters, posting information in campus buildings, and organizing an annual Emergency Preparedness Fair. The fair is held in October in upper Sproul Plaza, and different emergency service groups from the campus and the community participate. <p>In the event of a major disaster, information, assistance, and resources will be coordinated at Emergency Management Areas (EMAs). The campus is divided into several EMAs. You can find out where to go by looking for signs posted at exits in many buildings, on the map in the back of the campus phone directory, or by calling (642-9036).<p>If you live in the residence halls, you will receive instruction on what to do in emergency situations by the hall staff. On-going training is available throughout the year.<p>If you'd like to learn more about Emergency Preparedness, or volunteer for the program, call OEP (1 Sproul Hall; thm@uclink.berkeley.edu; 642-9036). <dl><dt>Publications include:<dd>Emergency supply and training resources<dd>What to do in case of ...fire, earthquake, etc., emergency information</dl><p><strong>Be prepared!</strong><br>As with personal safety, emergency preparedness requires forethought. Spend a few minutes now reviewing these OEP checklists that could save you time and possibly your life in an emergency.<p><strong>Things to know</strong><br>o  Learn the evacuation routes where you live and in buildings you use often.<br>o  Know where fire extinguishers and pull alarms are located. <br>o  Work out a plan ahead of time for contacting your friends and family to let them know you're safe. (Think about an out-of-state contact; phone lines are likely to be jammed where you are, and you should avoid all but emergency calls.)<br>o  Take first aid and CPR training courses.<p><strong>Prepare your room for an earthquake</strong><br>o  Remove heavy objects from high shelves, tops of cabinets, and above where you sit or sleep.<br>o  Remove hanging items or securely anchor them to the wall.<br>o  Bolt or anchor tall cabinets and bookcases to the wall.<br>o  Secure computers and typewriters to desk tops, and restrain books on shelves.<br>o  Keep exit routes clear and arrange desks and tables so that they will not slide and block exits.<p><strong>Things to do in your residence hall, house, or apartment</strong><br>o  Organize and participate in a simple evacuation drill. <br>o  Find out who knows first aid, CPR, search and rescue, or how to operate a ham radio.<p><strong>Supplies to keep on hand in your home and/or car</strong><br>o  A flashlight and spare batteries<br>o  First aid kit<br>o  Cash<br>o  An AM/FM portable radio with extra batteries<br>o  A blanket or coat, durable shoes, and heavy gloves (to help remove rubble during a rescue)<br>o  Food and water for 3 days<br>o  Extra prescription medicines, glasses, contact lenses and solution<br>o  A whistle<p><strong>What to do during an earthquake</strong><br><strong>If you're inside</strong><br>When you feel an earthquake duck under a sturdy object, like a desk or a door frame, and hold onto it.<p>If you're not near a sturdy object, duck and protect your head with your arms.<p>Avoid windows, filing cabinets, bookcases, and heavy objects that could shatter or fall.<p>Watch out for falling plaster, ceiling tiles, and light fixtures.<p>Stay under cover until the shaking stops, then evacuate the building.<p>Use stairs only; do not use elevators.<p><strong>If you're outside</strong><br>Move away from trees, signs, buildings, and electrical poles and wires.<p>Protect your head with your arms from falling bricks, glass, plaster, and other debris.<p><strong>Did you know...</strong><br>McCone Hall has a seismograph located in the west entrance lobby.

Buses, trains, cable cars, trolleys, a subway, even ferry boats move people around the Bay Area. Wheelchair access is available along most routes as well. The University's alternative transportation program, New Directions, offers student discounts on tickets for a variety of transit agencies, including BART (the subway) and AC Transit (the East Bay bus company). These tickets, along with information and tickets for most other Bay Area transit agencies, are available at the Berkeley TRiP Commute Store. <p><hr><strong>Berkeley TRiP</strong><p><strong>Berkeley TRiP</strong> (Transit/Ridesharing/Parking) in downtown Berkeley provides free information and assistance about campus commute alternatives such as BART, bicycle, bus, carpool, or vanpool. The staff can help you with an instant carpool matchlist or with transit route planning and ticket purchasing for all transit systems. They can also sell you a comprehensive street map of Berkeley for $1.50. To learn more about carpooling and special Cal student discounts on public transit, including AC Transit and BART, visit or call Berkeley TRiP (2033 Center Street; brk_trip@uclink. berkeley.edu; 643-POOL).<p><strong>The New Directions in Transportation Program</strong> helps students get to campus without daily use of a car. New Directions provides effective and low cost alternatives tailored to meet a wide variety of travel needs, reduces demand for scarce campus parking, and cuts back on traffic congestion and air pollution. The program offers discounts, subsidies, and incentives for use of public transit and ridesharing. To sign up for New Directions Program discounts, contact Berkeley TRiP (643-7665 or 644-7665).<p><strong>East bay buses</strong><p><strong>The AC Transit</strong> bus system serves Alameda and Contra Costa Counties (Berkeley is in Alameda County). Call for fare and route information (1-800-559-INFO, or TDD 1-800-448-9790).<p>From the Berkeley BART Station (Center and Shattuck) you can catch these major bus lines:<p>#7	Arlington and Shattuck, Claremont Area, last bus at 11:30pm<br>#8	Hearst and Euclid (restricted hours, call AC Transit)<br>#15	Martin Luther King, Jr. Way, last bus at 11:30pm<br>#40	Telegraph Avenue, last bus at midnight<br>#43	Shattuck Avenue, last bus at midnight<br>#51	University and College Avenues, last bus at midnight<br>#52	Albany Village, Cedar and Shattuck Avenues, last bus at 10pm<br>#64	Goes to Merritt College in Oakland, stops at Berkeley campus, last bus at 10:30pm<br>#65	Euclid and Hearst, to Grizzly Peak, last bus at 8pm<br>#F	This bus goes across the Bay Bridge to San Francisco and can be caught along Shattuck Avenue. (Any bus with a letter-only eventually goes to the San Francisco Transbay Terminal at First and Mission Streets.) Last bus at midnight.<p>AC Transit schedules are available at Berkeley TRiP (2033 Center Street; 643-POOL).<p><hr><strong>BART</strong><br><strong>Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)</strong> is the Bay Area's subway system and runs from 4am to midnight weekdays, 6am to midnight Saturdays, and 8am to midnight Sundays. (Its lines connect Richmond, Concord, Fremont, and San Francisco/Colma.) Discount tickets for kids, senior citizens, disabled, and Cal students are available. Most connecting transit systems, such as MUNI and AC Transit, honor BART discount transfers which are obtained in BART stations when exiting (465-2278; TTY 839-2220).<p><strong>San Francisco transportation</strong><br><strong>MUNI</strong> is the public transportation network which serves San Francisco and includes bus, cable-car, and metro transit systems. Call for fare and route information (415/673-MUNI).<p><hr><strong>To campus</strong><br>If you're commuting to campus by BART there are two stops you can use. The first is the Berkeley Station along the Richmond line which drops you off one block from the west side of campus. The Campus Shuttle Service (25 cents), which you can catch at Shattuck and Center, drops people off along the perimeter of campus and at Hearst Mining Circle. For those of you who enjoy walking, the West entrance to the Berkeley campus is only two blocks away (642-5149). <p>If you're coming from the Concord line, you might want to get off at the Rockridge Station and take a #7, #51 or #64 AC Transit bus to Bancroft Way. Taking the bus is usually faster than transferring BART lines to get to the Berkeley BART Station, plus the bus stops are more convenient to the Southside of campus.<p><strong>All roads lead to Cal</strong><br><strong>To get to Berkeley from the North:</strong> Take Highway 80 West to Berkeley's University Avenue exit. Head east on University Avenue (away from the bay) about 2 1/2 miles. University Avenue ends at the west end of campus.<p><strong>From the South:</strong> Take Highway 880 North to the exit for Highways 980 and 24 in Oakland. (The sign says Walnut Creek, but you won't be going that far.) Stay on Highway 980 (which turns into Highway 24 East) past the Highway 580 turnoffs--you will be following signs for Telegraph Avenue. Take the Martin Luther King, Jr. Way/51st Street exit (the first exit past the Highway 580 interchange). Bear right, still following signs for Telegraph Avenue. At the stop sign, which is 51st Street, turn right. Go through the light (Shattuck Avenue), take the next left onto Telegraph Avenue. Proceed north on Telegraph Avenue until it ends at the campus.<p><strong>From the East:</strong> Take Highway 680 South to Highway 24 westbound through the Caldecott Tunnel. Take the Telegraph Avenue exit. Turn right at the light, proceed north on Telegraph Avenue until it ends at the southern border of the campus.<p><strong>From the West:</strong> Cross the Bay Bridge eastbound. Take Highway 80 westbound towards Berkeley, get off at the University Avenue exit. Follow University Avenue east until it hits the campus, about 2 1/2 miles later.<p><strong>Watch out!</strong><br>Drivers coming from the North (e.g. Richmond) or the West (San Francisco) will encounter long-term I-80 freeway construction. Increased traffic congestion is expected, so you may want to leave your car at home and use public transportation.<p><hr><strong>Long distance ride sharing</strong><br><strong>The Ride Board</strong> contains cards posted by students offering or seeking rides to just about anywhere (lower level, The Bear Student Stores, near the CUBS credit union entrance). <p><strong>KALX Ridefinder</strong> is read daily at 10am and 10pm over the air on your campus radio station, KALX 90.7 FM (642-5259).<p><hr><strong>Parking on campus</strong><br><strong>All-day parking</strong> is available at student lots around the campus and requires a parking permit plus a daily entry fee. (Currently the fee is $3 a day, plus a $30 yearly transportation fee.) Registered students residing outside a two mile radius of campus are eligible for permits. Information about entry fees and parking permit applications are available at Parking and Transportation (7:30am-noon and 1pm-5pm; 2535 Channing Way; 642-4283). <p><strong>Satellite parking</strong> is available at the Botanical Garden lot on Centennial Drive, and you can catch the Hill Shuttle to campus. There are semester and annual fees (642-4283).<p><strong>Night and weekend parking</strong> on campus is available after 5pm, weekdays, and all day on weekends and requires a parking permit and/or daily entry fee. Parking overnight is not allowed, and cars will be towed (642-4283). <p><strong>Residence hall parking</strong> is available on a limited basis to students with medical, academic, job-related, or other special needs. There are semester and annual fees (642-4283).<p><strong>Storage lot parking</strong>, available for students who do not qualify for residence hall parking but who want to use their cars on weekends and on breaks, is located at Folger and 67th in Berkeley. The lot is alarmed and accessible by public transportation. There are semester and annual fees (642-4283).<p><strong>Public parking</strong> is available in the MLKJ Student Union Garage M-Sa, 8am-9pm and Su, 1pm-8:30pm (Bancroft Way, below Telegraph Avenue, to the right, 642-4284). <p><strong>Disabled students</strong> may request a disabled parking permit (for a fee) from the Parking and Transportation office (2535 Channing Way; 642-4283).<p><strong>Graduate students</strong> who need to park on campus in the evenings to use laboratories or special equipment can get a night parking permit at a reduced rate; the permit is valid seven days a week from 8pm to 6am (642-4283).<p><strong>Note</strong><br>All parking hours and regulations are strictly enforced by Parking and Transportation, and violating vehicles are subject to citation and fines (e.g. a $26 fine for not displaying a current daily permit).<p><strong>Residential Parking Permit Program</strong><br>Parking in Berkeley can be more hassle than it's worth! The City of Berkeley requires residents of neighboring campus areas to obtain a special permit for parking on city streets. Without the permit, parking is limited to two hours only (644-6470).<p><strong>Hey there!</strong><br>Parking in Berkeley is awful; there isn't much street parking near the campus, and the competition is tight for what little there is. (Fines for illegal parking, such as a meter violation, start at $20 a pop. And, those metermaids and lads don't loaf around!) Campus Parking Services issues four times as many permits as there are fee lot spaces. So, it may be in your best interest to leave your car at home and to take advantage of the Bay Area's public transit system.<p><hr><strong>Bicycles and other vehicles</strong><br>Bicycles can be parked in bike lots all over campus. Always secure the wheels and frame of your bicycle to a fixed object (e.g. bicycle rack) with a U-shaped lock, in well-lit, well-traveled areas; unsecured bicycles are subject to confiscation. Bikes parked on landscaped areas, locked to plants, trees or handrails, or which impede pedestrian traffic will also be cited. If your bike gets impounded (for locking your bike to a handrail, for instance), you'll be charged a $10 release fee and if needed, a $6 fee for bike registration. In addition to the bike lots listed in the skinny column, residence halls have outdoor racks, and some have bike rooms (check with your unit manager).<p><strong>Bicyclists</strong> can ride on roadways and designated pathways, but will be cited and fined for cycling in pedestrian areas (such as Sproul Plaza). Fines vary between $50-$104 and are determined by traffic court. <p>California law requires bikes to be licensed. Campus registration is available through Parking and Transportation (M and F, 1pm-5pm; 2427 Dwight Way; 642-6018). <dl><dt>Publications include:<dd>UC Berkeley Bike Book</dl><p><strong>For bicycle commuting,</strong> Berkeley TRiP has a variety of resources including bicycle maps and safety tips, campus cycling information (including route maps and bicycle rack locations), a listing of state bicycle laws, and a list of bicycle advocacy groups in the Bay Area (2033 Center Street; 643-7665).<p><strong>Avoid bike theft</strong> on campus by following these guidelines:<br>License your bicycle.<br>Use a U-lock or other high-end security device (don't buy a $20 lock for a $500 bike!) and leave as little space as possible inside the U-lock.<br>Lock both tires and the frame to a bicycle parking rack and secure the seat, and choose a well-lit, well-traveled area.<br>Do not leave your bicycle out overnight.<p><strong>Scooters and motorcycles</strong> can only be parked at designated motorcycle lots. There is an annual permit fee and a semesterly parking fee (642-4283). Mopeds must be parked at bicycle racks. Motor vehicles can only be driven on major paved campus roads, and they must be licensed with the DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles).<p><hr><strong>Driver's license</strong><br>To obtain a California State Driver's License (CDL) or, if you don't drive, a California State Identification Card you must go to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). This is an important step to take if you plan on writing checks or becoming a California resident for tuition purposes. A CDL costs $12, and a state ID card costs $6. You will also need to bring your birth certificate (certified copy or original) or passport, and social security card, or greencard. And, you may need to call ahead to make an appointment.<p><strong>Oakland DMV:</strong> M, 8am-6:30pm; Tu, Th-Fr, 8am-5pm; W, 9am-5pm; 5300 Claremont Avenue (two blocks above Telegraph Avenue); 450-3691, TTY 1-800/DMV-HEAR; appointments, 450-3620.<p><strong>El Cerrito DMV:</strong> Tu-Sa, 8am-5pm; W, 9am-5pm; 6400 Manila Avenue (at San Pablo Avenue); 235-9171, TTY 1-800/DMV-HEAR.<p><hr><strong>Good student insurance discounts</strong><br>Many insurance companies give discounts to students with a 3.0 or above GPA. If you qualify, ask your agent for a form, and take it to the Office of the Registrar for verification (128 Sproul Hall; 642-1883).<p><hr><strong>To and from airports </strong><br>The easiest way to get to or from the Oakland and San Francisco airports is to take a shuttle-van, which is like a taxi, but much less expensive with fares running from $10-16 (ask if there's a student discount). When taking a shuttle, be sure to call the company well ahead of time to make a reservation and to confirm departure times.<p><strong>Airport Connection</strong> provides door to door shuttles to the Oakland Airport and the San Francisco Airport (841-0150).<p><strong>Bay Porter shuttles</strong> pick you up at your doorstep and run to both airports with early morning and evening shuttles to San Francisco (415/467-1800). <p><strong>BART</strong> and an easy transfer will get you to the Oakland Airport. Catch the Richmond/Fremont line in the Fremont direction and get off at the Coliseum stop. Then, take an Air-BART shuttle, run by the airport, which leaves every 10 minutes and costs $2. This is the least expensive option.<p><hr><strong>Campus Bus Service</strong<br>People with a UC Berkeley Transit Bus Pass or students with an AC Transit or BART Student Semester Pass can ride both shuttles described below for free on weekdays (schedule information; 642-5149).<p><strong>The Perimeter Campus Shuttle</strong> operates 7am to 6:15pm, M-F, from the Central Berkeley BART (Shattuck and Center Streets) to the Hearst Mining Circle making stops at Oxford and University Streets, and along Hearst Avenue. After leaving the Hearst Mining Circle, the Shuttle returns to the BART station, making stops along Piedmont Avenue and Bancroft Way. A roundtrip takes 20 minutes; the fare is 25 cents.<p><strong>The Hill Shuttle</strong> operates 7:45am to 6:30pm, M-F, and leaves from Hearst Mining Circle and goes to the Strawberry Canyon Recreational Area, Botanical Gardens, Lawrence Hall of Science, Space Science Laboratory, and Math Science Research Institute; the fare is 50 cents.<p><strong>Inter-campus Shuttle Service:</strong><br>(Call ahead to find out about tickets.)<br>UC Davis	916/752-8287<br>UC Santa Cruz	408/459-2803<br>UC San Francisco	415/476-1511<br>Mills College Shuttle	510/430-2130 <p><strong>Night Safety Shuttles</strong><p><a name="Jobs"><h3><hr noshade>Jobs</h3></a><a href="http://www.aad.berkeley.edu/uga/osl/cgss/"><strong>Career and Graduate School Services (CGSS)</strong></a><br>If you're looking for a job, CGSS is the central clearinghouse for part-time, temporary, campus and off-campus, internship, or summer job opportunities (2111 Bancroft Way; 642-1716). <p>For information on other CGSS services such as career counseling and the Resource Center, check page 46.<p><hr><strong>Campus jobs</strong><br><strong>The ASUC</strong> provides over 500 jobs and is an outstanding opportunity for students to bridge the gap between school and work by developing technical, managerial, and inter-personal skills through positions designed especially for students.

The application deadline is generally in early March, approximately five months prior to the beginning of the academic year (for example, March 2, 1996 for the academic year beginning in August 1996). Meeting the application deadline is important as financial aid funding is generally insufficient for late applicants. Information, applications, and counseling are available from the Financial Aid Office. Programs are open only to US citizens, permanent residents, or eligible non-citizens.<p>There are two units of the Financial Aid Office, each serving a different part of the student population. Contact your unit when you have questions or problems:<p><strong>Undergraduate:</strong> 211 Sproul Hall; 642-6442 <p><strong>Graduate, Law and Optometry Students:</strong> 201 Sproul Hall; 642-0485 (There is also a satellite office for law students at 220 Boalt Hall; 642-1563.)<p><strong>International students</strong> are eligible for grants and work-study after completing two semesters at Berkeley. Financial aid applications for the next academic year are available in January and February. For information and assistance with other financial needs, contact Services for International Students and Scholars (International House; 2299 Piedmont Avenue; siss@uclink.berkeley.edu; 642-2818). <p><hr><strong>Undergraduates</strong><br>The Financial Aid Office does its best to meet full financial need, usually offering you a combination of the following types of aid:<p><strong>Grants</strong> are based entirely on financial need and have no requirements for repayment. Grant monies include federal programs such as the Pell Grant, Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (SEOG), state programs (Cal Grant A and Cal Grant B), and University programs, including the University Grant-in-Aid (211 Sproul Hall; 642-6442). <p><strong>Scholarships</strong> are awarded to undergraduate students who have demonstrated academic excellence and exceptional promise. They are honorary or need-based. Applications are included in the undergraduate admissions packet (210 Sproul Hall; 642-6363). (See pages 28-29 for more information.)<p><strong>Work-study</strong> enables students to work part-time during school and vacation periods. If you are awarded work-study, you must apply for a job through the Work-study Office (212 Sproul Hall; 642-5625). <p><strong>Loans</strong> are available to nearly all students. They are awarded on the basis of financial need and are repayable with interest, after graduation or withdrawal from school. The four major loan programs are the Perkins Loan, formerly called NDSL, the Health Professions Student Loan, the Ford Direct Loan, and the PLUS loan for parents. Contact Financial Aid (211 Sproul Hall; 642-6442). <p><strong>Note</strong><br>Students needing to certify their enrollment for financial aid reasons (like loan deferments) should visit the Verifications Unit (128 Sproul Hall; 642-1883).<p><strong>Emergency Loans</strong> are available to help students with cash flow problems during the academic year. All registered students can apply for a short-term interest-free loan of up to $425, which takes about 1 hour to process and is repayable within 60 days (205 Sproul Hall; 642-0470). <p><strong>University Loans</strong> (loans for higher amounts and require a co-signer) are available at the Loans and Receivables Office (192 University Hall; 642-3190). <p><hr><strong>Graduates</strong><br>The key to finding financial support for graduate study is to plan ahead. Deadlines for most University-sponsored support are in January of the preceding academic year. Extramural fellowships often require a year's lead time.<p>Graduate students are eligible for two types of University-sponsored financial assistance: <br><strong>1) Need-based support</strong><br>Loans, grants, and work-study programs are administered by the Graduate Unit of the Financial Aid Office (201 Sproul Hall; 642-0485).<p><strong>2) Merit-based support</strong><br>Fellowships are administered by the Graduate Division's Fellowships and Appointments Office. If you're interested in financial assistance provided by government, foundations, or private agencies, the Fellowships and Appointments Office is the place to begin your search. In September the office distributes a list of major graduate fellowship competitions and their deadlines, follow-up information, and applications for major national fellowship programs such as the National Science Foundation and Fulbright awards. The Fellowships and Appointments Office also maintains an up-to-date index compiled from a variety of sources including the Annual Register of Grant Support and The Grants Register to help you research potential grant opportunities (318 Sproul Hall; 642-0672). <p><strong>The Graduate Opportunity Program</strong> awards financial assistance to eligible underrepresented minority students (316 Sproul Hall; 642-5727). <p><strong>Some departments</strong> also have fellowships to offer; ask your graduate assistant.<p><strong>Graduate Student Researcher and Graduate Student Instructor</strong> (formerly Research Assistant and Teaching Assistant) appointments are an important source of income to Berkeley graduate students, although their availability varies from department to department. To be eligible, you must have a 3.1 GPA, be a full-time registered student, and have no more than two incompletes. You must also enroll in at least eight units of graduate course work. Apply directly to the department in which you are interested. You may be appointed to either title no more than half time during the academic year; if you have a fellowship or traineeship, you're limited to an average of quarter time during the academic year.<a href="Refunds checks"><p><hr><strong>How you get your financial aid</strong></a><br>Most grant or loan funds will be credited to your Campus Accounts Receivables System (CARS) account and will be used to offset any debts owed to the campus (e.g. semester fees, campus housing, and miscellaneous charges). Monies not credited to your CARS account are: <br>Alumni/outside agency scholarships<br>Graduate student fellowship stipends<br>Emergency loans<p>Any money left over on your account after your aid has been applied will be refunded to you. The earliest you can get a refund is the week before classes start. <p>Refunds can be directly deposited to your checking or savings account via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Because EFT takes 30 days to activate, you should submit an EFT Authorization Form as soon as you open a bank account.<p>Students who have not authorized an EFT will have their monies mailed to them in a check, so it's important to keep the University informed about any address changes (see Bear Facts, page 34).<p>For an EFT Authorization Form, or for information on check disbursement, contact the Loans and Receivables Office (M-F, 8:30am-4pm; 192 University Hall; lro2@uclink. berkeley.edu; 642-3190). <p><hr><strong>Scholarship information</strong><br>Honorary or need-based scholarships are available for students with exceptional achievements.

A few people in my residence hall went from floor to floor during our first week meeting everyone else in the building. I felt more at home after meeting my new neighbors.<dd>Elizabeth A. Fernandez, Junior<br>Political Science<p><dt>The co-op system is cool because it's student owned and run. It has a sense of community, and it is a lot cheaper than the dorms.<dd>Erika Hartman, Junior<br>Social Welfare<p><dt>As a transfer student I didn't want to live in the dorms because I desired a quieter atmosphere. I found out about the co-ops, and each house has its own personality, (e.g. quiet or loud, big or small, meat eating or vegetarian, all female or co-ed). I choose what I desired, and now I live happily and cooperatively, enjoying a low rent also!<dd>Nicole Cázares, Junior<br>American Studies<p><dt>I was so concerned about the whole roommate situation. I would have terrible thoughts about that "roommate from hell!" Now though, I have the best roommate anyone could've asked for, we get along great. Anytime there is a problem, we always work it out. However, I know that if there were to be a terrible disagreement, the RAs are there at all times to help in the solution.<dd>Carla Corona, First year<br>Undeclared<p><dt>Most people think of the Tang Center as just a clinic, but the education and information services provided are incredible. A friend and I went to the Women's Health Care Service for an hour-long private information session about STDs, contraception devices, and basic women's health care issues. The education counselor was friendly, knowledgeable, and sensitive to issues brought up by different cultural backgrounds.<dd>Carrie Ward, Junior<br>Applied Math<p><dt>The UHS Tang Center was incredibly convenient, friendly, and did not take up a large part of my time.<dd>Ryan Bauer, First year<br>Psychology<p><dt>The only one here whose primary interest in life is to take care of you, is you. So work hard, play hard, make Cal your own. And through it all, make sure you take care of yourself in all the ways that you need. We can show you how, and we can help. But you may have to give us a clue that something's up.<dd>Cara L. Vaughn, Public Information Officer<br>University Health Services<p><dt>During my O-Chem lab, I had gouged myself really badly with a glass pipette. With the help of the Tang Center's Urgent Care Service, my injury healed pretty nicely in about a week. In their clinic, they were very specific in determining how to patch my finger up, making sure there was no sign of any unwanted chemicals. As an extra precaution, they were kind enough to give me a tetanus shot!<dd>Jason Wu, Sophomore<br>Chemical Engineering<p><dt>Explore, explore, explore! The only way you'll feel safe in Berkeley is if you're familiar with the environment. Walk around and get a feel for the area--don't just stick to the campus. Use Berkeley TRiP, and take advantage of the shuttle system. Get to know the areas, where you'll want to go, where you'll want to avoid. Ask around, people who have lived here a while know.<dd>Rita Zobayan, Graduate<br>Single Subject Credential<p><dt>For those late night study sessions in far away dorms, Cal-B-Safe can ease one's worries about late night travel.<dd>Irami Osei-Frimpong, First year<br>Philosophy<p><dt>During my first semester at Cal, I walked down Telegraph with a friend. We encountered several beggars, some spiked hair teenagers on a corner, and a man walking by us, just talking to himself very loudly. At first, we were kind of freaked out. My friend looked at me and said, "I just don't get it. What's going on?" We were really caught off guard by our new environment. My advice, don't worry or panic. It's part of our community and something to get used to.<dd>Alice Lee, Junior<br>Political Science<p><dt>Everyone may be friendly, but everyone is not a friend. Don't allow new aquaintances into your living space or access to personal information about you until you have gotten to know them better. Many con-artists target new students because of their inexperience.<dd>Tiye Candace Scott<br>Campus Safety Programs<p><dt>I went to Berkeley TRiP, and it was sooooo great! I was afraid to go there initially because I thought they would be mean, or laugh at me because I didn't know what I was doing. I knew only my destination, and the woman at the front desk gave me maps, time tables, and lots of advice on how to get there. She was very nice, helpful, and friendly, and she gave me great (accurate!) advice, and it made my trip into the City by bus and BART incredibly enjoyable.<dd>Kimberly Smith, First year<br>Undeclared<p><dt>On any given day there are parking spaces available for permit holders. The spaces are not always close by but they do provide parking options. The Foothill parking lot at the top of Hearst is one example.<dd>Patricia Vani, Administrative Manager<br>Parking and Transportation<p><dt>When I was new to campus I was afraid I would never find my way around or get to class on time because everything seemed so far away. Once I was familiar with the paths and shortcuts, it didn't take too long to walk from building to building, plus the land-scape's so beautiful it's like taking a walk in a park.<dd>Jenne Mowry<br>Ex-student<p><dt>I like the Campus Conductor [campus shuttle] be-cause I live very far on the Northside. I hate having to walk all the way home, and the Conductor takes me two blocks away and, the price is rights--it's free. <dd>James Dismuke, Sophomore<br>Civil Engineering<p><dt>Before I came to Berkeley I was fretting over what mode of transportation I'd use around campus. Since I live in Unit 3, I found that walking is good enough.<dd>Leo Cheng, First year<br>Undeclared<p><dt>When I was a student, I came to realize that the more hours I put into my part-time job or extra-curricular activities, the better my grades got. When you're just going to school. you tend to slack off and procrastinate. But when you're busy all the time, you manage your study time better.<dd>Jim Yu, Administrative Analyst<br>Police Department<p><dt>When I was unclear about the information I was receiving from financial aid, I needed to speak with somebody about what all the papers meant or who should be sent what. I immediately went to financial aid. I was given great customer service, and I left satisfied knowing how to go about the payments.<dd>Andrea Lopez, Junior<br>Mass Communications<p><dt>Work study jobs on campus are convenient, flexible, enriching, and most of all, they pay great!<dd>Gayle Bernabe, Sophomore<br>Intended Environmental SciencePolicy and Management<p><dt>The Berkeley campus can be an intimidating place for new students due to the large size and multitude of different people. The best thing to remember is to go in with a persistent and positive attitude...even to the financial aid office!<dd>Nishi Moonka, Junior<br>Molecular and Cell Biology/Psychology<p><dt>As a general rule, don't hesitate to ask questions to find out what you need to know. If you don't ask, then you will be lost in the crowd of 30,000 other students here. The phone is really good. You can call anywhere, and they usually can answer your questions right over the phone. People are willing to help you, but they're not going to come to you. You must initiate the lines of communications. Be patient, but persistent, and stay well informed.<dd>Russell Chung, Sophomore<br>Undeclared<p><dt>A key to success: Be persis-tent! Don't be discouraged by long lines, make sure you understand the important policies, and remember: you have a right to be heard! So if you ever feel like you're getting the run-around, just be persistent and get your problems settled. You'll always be glad you did.<dd>Chriscelle Merquillo, Sophomore<br>Chemistry<p> Go to:<br><a href="r96ToC.html"><STRONG>Resource table of contents</STRONG></a><br><a href="r4Preparingforclass.html"><STRONG>Next chapter</STRONG></a><br><a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/"><STRONG>UC Berkeley Home Page</STRONG></a>
