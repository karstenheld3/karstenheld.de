A third way is to find a faculty sponsor for a Field Study (97/197/297), Independent Study (99/199/299) or Directed Group Study (98/198/298) class. (The 90s are lower division, 190s are upper division, and the 290s are graduate.) Check your College or School Announcement for more information.<a name="ProjectforCollaborativeLearning"><p><strong>Project for Collaborative Learning</strong></a><br>Do you want to teach or develop your own class? The Project for Collaborative Learning is a resource for students or groups interested in collaborative learning and student-run courses. You can take a one-unit class to learn about collaborative learning, develop a proposal, and then apply for a stipend to actually complete your project.<p>Three existing courses (see Student Learning Center, page 42), Ethnic Perspectives, Other Voices, and Unseen America form the initial core of the program (Student Learning Center; Golden Bear Center; 643-5737).<p><strong>DE-Cal (Democratic Education at Cal)</strong><br>DE-Cal is an ASUC-sponsored organization which offers 25 to 30 student-initiated, student-taught classes for credit each semester. Some past courses have included: <p>African American Perspective to   Health Sciences<br>Cultural Change 1960-1990<br>Environmental Solutions<br>The Erotic as Power<br>Esperanto<br>Feminist Issues in Women's Health<br>Ho'Lo' Taiwanese<br>Homelessness: Issues and Action<br>Joy of Garbage<br>NAFTA and Its Impacts<br>Spiritual Exploration of World Religions<p>Most classes are small, offer a high degree of student participation, and the subject matter is usually outside the traditional curriculum. You can add DE-Cal classes during the Tele-BEARS adjustment periods. Course listings are not available in the General Catalog or the Schedule of Classes, but you can find out about them at the ASUC Bookstore, at the CalSO Resource Center, and through the DE-Cal office (320 Eshleman Hall; 642-9127).<p>DE-Cal is a good alternative for students who need to add classes. Since DE-Cal classes won't accept enrollment until the first day of instruction, you'll have just as good a chance as anyone else to get in. And, DE-Cal classes are sure to add some zing to a traditional course load. <p><hr><a href="http://www.ls.berkeley.edu/Ugis/FSP/fsp.html"><strong>Freshman Seminar Program</strong></a><br>The Freshman Seminar Program arose from the conviction that early intellectual contact with faculty members would greatly enhance the freshman experience at Cal. Beginning in the fall semester 1992, professors from every campus department have joined to offer an impressive array of new seminars. The courses numbered 24 (and in some cases 90) bear one unit of credit; they are limited to fifteen students, and freshmen will be given priority for enrollment. <p>The other new seminars, most of which are numbered 39, are limited to twenty-five (or fewer) freshmen and sophomores. <p>Seminars, which emphasize interaction and discussion, provide a nice counterpoint to the learning experience in our campus' large lecture halls. These seminars also offer lower-division students an unprecedented opportunity to explore a wide range of majors and even fields of study usually reserved for graduate students. A brochure describing each semester's seminar offerings is mailed to each freshman in time for Tele-BEARS registration (301 Campbell Hall; 642-8378).<a name="Tutorforcredit"><p><hr><strong>Tutor for credit</strong></a><br>You can serve your community and earn units for doing so by tutoring in local schools. You earn one unit for every three hours per week in a classroom or tutoring center under the courses Education 97 (lower division students) and Education 197 (upper division). You can tutor almost any subject, at any grade level, at almost any time of day, in any number of schools. Check the bulletin board on the first floor of Tolman Hall, outside by the Student Services Office (School of Education; 642-5345).<p><hr><a href="http://www-summer.berkeley.edu"><strong>Summer Sessions</strong></a><br>Berkeley Summer Sessions offers over 350 courses in 65 academic departments and is an ideal way to accelerate your academic program, learn a language, or make up a deficiency. Over the course of twelve weeks you can complete a full semester of coursework; there are five different sessions to choose from, varying in length from three to ten weeks and beginning as early as May or as late as July. All courses carry regular academic credit and will be recorded on your UC Berkeley transcript.<p>Summer Sessions Catalogs are mailed to all Berkeley undergraduates in March. To add your off-campus friends to the mailing list, contact Berkeley Summer Sessions (22 Wheeler Hall; summer@uclink. berkeley.edu; 642-5611).<p><a name="Research"><h3><hr noshade>Research</h3></a><p>One of the best ways to get involved in Berkeley's vast research opportunities is to ask the department secretary from a major department if he or she knows of a research project which fits your interests, or ask your professors. There are over 40 Organized Research Units directed by Berkeley professors and staff which can be found in the front Administration section of the Campus Telephone Directory or in the back of the General Catalog. Research opportunities for students are also listed in the CGSS publication, The Internship Directory (2111 Bancroft Way; 642-1716).<p><hr><strong>McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Program</strong><br>This program prepares Berkeley undergraduates for graduate study leading to a PhD. Fifty juniors are selected by competition to participate in academic-year, credit-bearing courses, summer research internships with Berkeley faculty, advising, and academic strengthening activities. Low-income, first-generation college students and members of groups underrepresented in graduate studies are encouraged to apply (Academic Achievement Division; 2515 Channing Way; 642-7935).<p><hr><strong>Summer Research Opportunities for Minority Undergraduates</strong><br>Underrepresented minority students (Alaskan Native, American Indian, African American, Mexican American, Puerto Rican or Filipino, and Latinos, Asian Americans, and women in a field of study where they are underrepresented) can apply to participate in an eight-week, full-time, faculty-sponsored, stipend-financed, research internship in the humanities or physical and social sciences for the summer. Continuing sophomores, juniors, and non-graduating seniors with a 3.0 GPA and an interest in pursuing graduate school are encouraged to submit an application, due February 1. <p>Other opportunities for undergraduate minority and women students are available. Check the publication, Continue the journey, or visit the Graduate Opportunity Program (Graduate Division; 316 Sproul Hall; 643-6010).<p><hr><a href="http://www.ls.berkeley.edu/Ugis/URAP/urap.html"><strong>Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program</strong></a><br>Highly motivated undergraduates can apply for semester or year-long opportunities to work closely with senior faculty on research projects. Undergraduates with a 2.0 GPA or above are eligible to apply and those selected may enroll in Undergraduate and Interdisciplinary Studies (UGIS) 192 (1-4 units, P/NP). Descriptions of projects are available in November and April for the following semesters (341 Campbell Hall, 642-3795).<p><hr><a href="http://www.mip.berkeley.edu/urep"><strong>University Research Expeditions Program (UREP)</strong></a>  <br>Join a UC Research Expedition, explore uncharted territories, preserve threatened environments, and unravel ancient mysteries while working side-by-side with a UC scientist on field research projects worldwide. UREP provides funds and student scholarships for field research in the natural and social sciences while simultaneously offering students, staff, and the general public educational field opportunities. Student scholarship applications for summer projects are due mid-March (2223 Fulton Street, fourth floor, desk CO3; urep@uclink. berkeley.edu, 642-6586).<p><a name="Multicultural opportunities"><h3><hr noshade>Multicultural opportunities</h3></a><p>Our diverse campus environment offers many unique ways to learn more about yourself, others, and the world in which we live.<p><hr><strong>Student Diversity Awareness Programs</strong><br><strong>Project DARE</strong> (Diversity Awareness through Resource and Education) and <strong>ME and U</strong> (Multicultural Exchange and Understanding) are experiential-based educational programs that orient students to multicultural issues in the context of promoting student retention and enhancing the campus climate for underrepresented groups (Academic Achievement Division; Maria Lucero Padilla; 2515 Channing Way; 643-6286).<p><strong>The Center for Racial Education </strong><br>The Center for Racial Education works to increase the level of cross-cultural awareness among members of our diverse campus community. The Center conducts educational workshops, DE-Cal courses, and special events which familiarize students, faculty, and staff with each other's cultural backgrounds and concerns. The Center also offers services that assist individuals, living groups, and work places to overcome inter-racial tensions and conflicts (312 Eshleman Hall; 643-9921).<p><hr><strong>I-House (International House)</strong><br>I-House offers a large number of cultural, educational, and recreational programs which encourage international discussion and understanding. I-House is a place where you can learn first-hand about the cultures and politics of other countries without leaving the US. All new students can become members of the I-House at a special discount rate. As a member, you can participate in many activities for free, and the Program News, a monthly publication announcing upcoming events, will be mailed to your home. Programs include aerobics, language tables, social dance, cultural performances, political discussions, trips and tours throughout the Bay Area, a Speakers Bureau for local schools, and arranging host families for international students (2299 Piedmont Avenue; 642-9460).<p><hr><a href="http://violet.berkeley.edu/~bpsa/home.html"><strong>Education Abroad Program (EAP) </strong></a><br>EAP allows undergraduates and graduates to experience higher education at 100 host universities and colleges in 33 countries. Offerings include full-year study programs as well as short-term and special-focus programs. Interested students should visit the EAP office in the fall prior to the year they wish to go abroad; there is a minimum GPA requirement of 3.0. The Study Abroad Office library has information on other study abroad programs (160 Stephens Hall, 642-1356).<p><strong>EAP countries</strong><br>Australia<br>Austria<br>Brazil<br>Canada<br>Chile<br>China<br>Costa Rica<br>Denmark<br>Egypt<br>France<br>Germany<br>Ghana<br>Hong Kong<br>Hungary<br>India<br>Indonesia<br>Ireland<br>Israel<br>Italy<br>Japan<br>Korea<br>Mexico<br>Netherlands<br>New Zealand<br>Russia<br>Singapore<br>Spain<br>Sweden<br>Taiwan<br>Thailand<br>United Kingdom<p><hr><strong>UC Extension programs abroad</strong><br><strong>The Summer Oxford/Berkeley Program</strong> offers three-week summer study programs at Worcester College, University of Oxford. Course selections include history, literature, political science, economics, and anthropology. <p><strong>The Paris Program</strong> offers a three-week, three-unit, summer study program in France. Courses are taught at a central Paris location by professors from all over France. Subjects include art history and history, and some courses are taught entirely in French.<p>You can get information about these and other noncredit travel/study programs at 415/252-5229.<p><strong>Note</strong><br>Acceptance of Extension credit is not automatic. You should consult with the dean of your college or school before enrolling in an Extension course for degree credit.<p><hr><a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov"><strong>Peace Corps</strong></a><br>Berkeley is the number one contributor of total number of Peace Corps volunteers. Since 1961, more than 3000 Cal students have been placed in assignments in over 100 countries all over the world. Assignments are for two years with transportation, medical support, and monthly allowances provided. Recruiting is year-round, and most programs require a degree. Contact the Peace Corps recruitment office to find out how you may qualify (415/744-2677 or 1-800/424-8580).<p><hr><strong>International student IDs </strong><br>Council Travel can issue International Student IDs which will make you eligible for discounts abroad. You will need $18, a photo ID, an extra passport photo, and University enrollment verification such as a Cal Photo ID or a transcript (2486 Channing Way; 848-8604).<p><hr><strong>Passports</strong><br>The US Main Post Office in Berkeley accepts applications for US Passports. You'll need $65, a birth certificate and a California state driver's license or state ID, and two passport photos (2000 Allston Way, room 109; 649-3178).<p><hr><strong>International and Area Studies</strong><br>Berkeley's international centers for research and outreach are part of our rich multicultural environment. Through concerts, lectures, special events, conferences, and seminars, you'll have opportunities to satisfy your personal and academic curiosity about other lands and cultures in over a dozen areas. Get yourself on the mailing list for events such as an Indonesian puppet show, a discussion seminar on planning for a new world order in the international economy, or a lecture on medicinal plants in Latin America. Whether you're interested in the humanities, sciences, or social sciences, you'll find the international dimension enriching to your Berkeley experience.<p><strong>International and Area Studies Programs</strong><br>Africa Center	642-8338<br>Canadian Studies Program	642-0531<br>Catalonian Studies Program	643-7856<br>Chinese Studies Center	643-6321<br>East Asian Studies Institute	642-2809<br>European Community Visitor	642-4555<br>French Cultural Studies Program 	643-5799<br>German and European Studies, Center for	643-5799<br>Iberian Studies Program	642-9314<br>Italian Research and Study Group	642-9314<br>Japanese Studies Center	642-3156<br>Korean Studies Center	642-5674<br>Latin American Studies Center	642-2088<br>Middle Eastern Studies Center	642-8208<br>Portuguese Studies Program	psp@uclink<br>Peace and Conflict Studies	642-4466<br>Slavic and East European Studies Center	642-3230<br>South Asian Studies Center	642-3608<br>Southeast Asian Studies Center	642-3609<br>Western European Studies Center	642-9314<br>International Studies, Institute of 	642-2472<br>Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy (BRIE)	642-3067<br>MacArthur Interdisciplinary Group in International Security Studies	642-2474<br>Program in Population Research	642-9800<p><a name="UC elsewhere"><h3><hr noshade>UC elsewhere</h3></a><p><a href="http://www-cmil.unex.berkeley.edu/"><strong>Center for Media and Independent Learning (CMIL)</strong></a><br>CMIL is a statewide department of University of California Extension which offers over 150 undergraduate and professional-level courses by mail, e-mail, and fax. The program is self-paced and enrollment is always open, giving you the opportunity to complete courses at times and places convenient to your schedule (2000 Center Street, room 444; 642-4124).<p><strong>One potential snag:</strong> undergraduate credit earned through CMIL is generally accepted at UC and other institutions, but check with your school or college to make sure they will accept the credits.<p><hr><strong>Education at Home Program (EHP)</strong><br>EHP is a one-quarter program conducted through UC Riverside that enables undergraduates to spend eight weeks on the East Coast (Williamsburg, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC) studying primarily Early American History (Department of History, UC Riverside; Riverside, CA 92421; 714/787-3820, or contact Victor Rotenberg; 3309 Dwinelle Hall; 642-0356).<p><a name="Exchange"><hr><strong>Howard University Exchange Program</strong></a><br>A one-semester undergraduate exchange program with Howard University in Washington DC has been established for declared majors in the College of Letters and Science. Students with a minimum GPA of 2.5 are eligible to apply.

This program gives you the opportunity to associate with scholars and fields of study not available at Berkeley and to use special facilities and collections of other campuses (Graduate Degrees and Petitions; 302 Sproul Hall; 642-7330).<p><hr><a href="http://www.unex.berkeley.edu:4243"><strong>University Extension</strong></a><br>UC Berkeley Extension is Berkeley's continuing education program offering additional educational opportunities at night and during the weekends for the community and Berkeley students. Extension courses cover most fields of study at levels from lower division to professional: many are interdisciplinary, focusing on new research and current developments (1995 University Avenue at Milvia; 642-4111).<p><strong>One potential snag:</strong> acceptance of Extension credit is not automatic. You should consult with the dean of your college or school before enrolling in an Extension course for degree credit.<p><a name="Internships"><h3><hr noshade>Internships</h3></a><p>Internships complement the University experience in valuable ways. You can apply knowledge acquired in the classroom to work situations, reality-test career options, develop skills, and gain experience unavailable through coursework alone. Internships can be found through the following programs and departments.<p><hr><strong>Campus programs</strong><br><strong>Career and Graduate School Services (CGSS)</strong> publishes The Internship Directory, a very good listing of campus resources for students (CGSS Resource Center; 2111 Bancroft Way, second floor; 642-1716).<p><strong>Cooperative Education Internship Program</strong> provides general internship advising and paid part-time or full-time positions in all disciplines. A co-op internship, which may be of varying duration, provides several unique benefits. In addition to career advising and a mentor-apprentice relationship with a professional, a transcript notation is also available (2111 Bancroft Way, third floor; 642-1532).<p><strong>Engineering Co-op</strong> offers undergraduate and graduate students opportunities for full-time, six month long internships in engineering, computer science, or chemical engineering positions with the government and in industry. Participants are on sanctioned "leave of absence" status from the University. Faculty usually visit students on the job to monitor and evaluate the training sites (306 McLaughlin; 642-6385).<p><hr><strong>Government programs</strong><br><strong>Cal-in-Berkeley Internship Program</strong> is a joint ASUC/UC/City of Berkeley program where students can get hands-on experience working in municipal government agencies ranging from public administration to energy conservation. Internships require an 8-12 hour per week commitment, and upper division students can receive academic credit (City and Regional Planning 197, 1-3 units, P/NP). Applications are available the first week of each semester (510 Eshleman Hall; 642-9041).<p><strong>Cal-in-Sacramento</strong> provides 30 students with legislative office and state agency internships during the summer. Internships are available to undergraduates and graduates and relate to every academic major and area of interest. Applications are available in early September and are due in October for the following summer. Financial aid is available (Alumni House; 642-7280).<p><strong>Cal-in-the-Capital</strong> sends about 70 students to Washington DC internships each summer. Placements range from Capitol Hill to the Smithsonian museums and include many fields such as engineering, the arts, science, health, the humanities, political, economic, and law-related areas. Applications are available in early September and are due in early October. Financial aid is available (Alumni House; 642-2920).<p><hr><strong>ASUC</strong> <br>Many internship possibilities are offered through the ASUC:<br>ASUC President's Office<br>Berkeley On-Line Information Systems<br>Black Recruitment and Retention Center<br>Break the Cycle (tutoring) <br>Cal Camp (summer camp counseling)<br>Cal-in-Berkeley<br>Cal-on-Campus<br>Center for Racial Education<br>DE-Cal<br>Health and Medical Apprenticeship Program <br>Native American Recruitment and Retention<br>Open Computing Facility<br>Queer Resource Center<br>Raza Recruitment and Retention Center<br>Recycling Project <br>Renters' Assistance Project for Students (RAPS)<br>Scientists' Support Group<br>Student Advocate's Office<br>Student Business Center<br>Student Legal Clinic<br>Student-to-Student Peer Counseling<br>Transfer Student Association<br>Women of Color Resource Center<p>Most of these programs are described elsewhere in Resource (check the Index), or you can visit the ASUC Office of Student Affairs for more information (400 Eshleman Hall; 642-5349).<p><strong>Health and Medical Apprenticeship Program (HMAP)</strong> is a joint program sponsored by the ASUC and the School of Public Health that supplements pre-health education by exposing undergraduates to critical health care issues. The IDS 130, "Social, Ethical, and Political Issues in Health and Medicine" seminar (2 units, P/NP) invites speakers with diverse backgrounds from around the country to speak about medical ethics. The Field Study internship (2 units, P/NP) places upper division students with practicing physicians in the community. The Health Service Internship Program (2 units, P/NP) coordinates volunteer work for students interested in public health and medicine. HMAP also produces a newsletter, Issues, which presents information about health and medicine for students and the community (309 Eshleman Hall; 643-6100).<p><a name="Volunteer activities"><h3><hr noshade>Volunteer activities</h3></a><p>Many volunteer positions, some for credit, are available in such programs as the California Alumni Association, CalPIRG, Department of Recreational Sports, KALX, Student Health Workers, Student Learning Center Peer Advising, and SUPERB. (Contact each department for information.) Also check page 43 for tutoring for credit.<p><hr><strong>Cal Corps Public Service Center</strong> <br>Cal Corps Public Service Center is the campus base and informational clearinghouse for community service efforts. <p><strong>The Volunteer Clearinghouse</strong> is a computerized database listing volunteer placements at over 200 community-based organizations in the Bay Area such as Habitat for Humanity, Berkeley Unified School District, San Francisco District Attorney's Office, and Project Open Hand. In addition, a new section details full-time volunteer opportunities, including the Peace Corps, City Year, and Public Allies, which students can undertake during a year off or after graduation. For students or groups who are unable to volunteer on a weekly basis, Cal Corps compiles a monthly listing of short-term service projects.<p><strong>The Student Community Service Grants Program</strong> offers grants, advising, and leadership development for students initiating and operating their own community service projects. Approximately 25 groups, ranging from tutorial and mentorship programs to health and legal services, are funded each year. <p><strong>Service-Learning Classes</strong> integrate community service into the academic curriculum. Students may receive 2-3 units (P/NP) for volunteering at a local agency and attending a seminar related to their service placements. Issues addressed include homelessness, tutoring, mentoring, and community development. <p><strong>AmeriCorps</strong> expands Cal student community service through President Clinton's National Service Program. National Service mobilizes young Americans to address pressing educational, environmental, public safety, and human needs while enhancing the educational experience, practical skills and sense of civic responsibility of those participating. At Cal, 12 AmeriCorps members work as paid community service coordinators part-time during the academic year, full-time during the summer, and will receive an educational monetary award at the end of their service term. The AmeriCorps recruitment and application process takes place in the spring semester. <p>Information about all these programs is available at the Cal Corps office (505 Eshleman Hall; calcorps@ofc. berkeley.edu; 642-3916).<p><hr><strong>Cal Camp </strong> <br>A tradition that dates back to the 1930s, this all-student volunteer ASUC organization provides leadership and encourages children to build a positive self-image at a nonprofit camp for socially and economically disadvantaged inner-city children between the ages of 7-11. If you would like to be a camp counselor for one week during the summer, please contact Cal Camp or stop by the office (300B Eshleman; 643-5005).<p><hr><strong>Stiles Hall </strong> <br>Students have the opportunity to participate in several outstanding community service projects at Stiles Hall. Student volunteers are trained to: serve as mentors and role models to low income and minority youth; work with children from drug or alcohol dependent families; tutor children in structured after-school programs; form meaningful friendships with local senior citizens; serve as companions to patients at Napa State Mental Hospital; and perform own-recognizance investigations for local courts and jails. Students develop personally and professionally while addressing significant community problems. Each project requires a two-semester, 4 to 6 hours/week consistent commitment. Credit is available for most positions. Selection takes place in early fall, so drop by Stiles Hall and speak with the staff about the variety of placements (2400 Bancroft Way at Dana, Berkeley, 94704; 841-6010).<p><hr><strong>University YWCA</strong> <br>For over 100 years the YWCA has been training and placing students in more than 50 East Bay community agencies. Volunteer opportunities include working with Children's Hospital, Berkeley School Volunteers, Planned Parenthood, Asian Health Services, Legal Assistance for Seniors, and many more. <p>In addition to the Volunteer Placement Program students may also volunteer through the YWCA's Youth Mentor Program and the English in Action Program. The Youth Mentor Program matches Cal students with at-risk teens in one-to-one relationships. Mentors and their younger students make a commitment for the entire academic year. English in Action matches foreign students and visiting scholars (at UC Berkeley) with English speaking partners for weekly conversation.<p>Academic credit is available for many placements (2600 Bancroft Way, Berkeley; 848-6370).<p><a name="Good advice"><h3><hr noshade>Good advice</h3></a><dl><dt>While you are here at Berkeley, try to take at least one Freshman Seminar.

If you're picky, there's cereal, a salad bar, plain rice, vegetables, and tons of basic stuff at every meal. They always serve fresh fruit and frozen yogurt. If you get creative, the food can be pretty good. People worry about gaining weight, so the dining hall has the nutrition information posted above all the entrées they serve. A lot of people skip breakfast, but it is the best meal here at Cal. The blueberry pancakes are the best! I'm thankful that I'm not in the South or the East eating fatty, fried foods and canned fruit like a lot of my friends. Skip the prepared entrées, and go for the self-serve food, where you can almost always make a fajita, sandwich, or plain pasta dish.<dd>Jane Watkinson, First year<br>Undeclared<p><dt>Make your own DC Rice Krispie Treats!

But don't freak-out! There are a variety of resources on campus that will help you negotiate and better understand exactly what the school has to offer. Whether you want to learn the Salsa, pursue multi-cultural opportunities, or just kick-back on a sunny afternoon on Sproul Plaza and listen to Rick Starr belt out a few of his favorite tunes, the University has people who can point you in the right direction; you just have to ask someone.<dd>R. Joel Corson, Junior<br>Rhetoric<p><dt>Cal Corps is a wonderful campus referral agency for students who are interested in volunteering a small amount of their time in community service to benefit others. Cal Corps has virtually every type of volunteer and community service opportunity that one may be interested in, so there is definitely something for everyone. Once you find possible projects you'd like to work with, Cal Corps compiles a list of them for you along with all the pertinent information, so that the search is extremely efficient.<dd>Michelle Lau, Junior<br>Intended Rhetoric<p><dt>Community service is an excellent way to work in partnership with local schools, cities, and non-profit organizations to expand your understanding of social issues, develop invaluable leadership skills and work on solutions to real-life problems! Enhance your educational experience at Cal by devoting your time and talents to meeting the needs of your community!<dd>Heidi Van Horn<br>Assistant Director Cal Corps<p><dt>Some see the enormous size of Cal as a downfall, but really it has a positive side. It's so large that you can be whomever you want and no one is going to look twice. In one semester you can be an ultra-conservative republican and in another a democrat, just to experience both sides,  That's kind of what students have to do at Cal, see the positive sides because negatives will only bring them down.<dd>Cristina Ponzalan, Senior,<br>Social Welfare<p><dt>Academic competition and stress have been the difficult part about Berkeley. The best thing has been the friends that I've made. They're always there for me.<dd>Angela S. Chen<br>First year, Undeclared<p><dt>I was real concerned about making friends when I came to Berkeley, especially because I'm shy and quiet at first. I learned that you need to be outgoing and open to make friends and meet people. Don't hide in your dorm room and then complain that you don't have any friends! Make an effort to meet people.<dd>Marion Vicente<br>First year, Undeclared<p> Go to:<br><a href="r96ToC.html"><STRONG>Resource table of contents</STRONG></a><br><a href="r8Campusactivities.html"><STRONG>Next chapter</STRONG></a><br><a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/"><STRONG>UC Berkeley Home Page</STRONG></a>
